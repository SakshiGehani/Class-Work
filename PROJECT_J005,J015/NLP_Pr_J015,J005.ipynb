By early afternoon that number had ballooned to $1.8 billion. And by evening it was $3.2 billion in loans that will go to more than 10,000 small businesses desperate to save themselves.\\n\\nIt was all part of a scramble by small businesses around the country to stay alive by grabbing a piece of a Treasury Department program to pump $349 billion into the sputtering U.S. economy. Small businesses, which employ nearly half of America‚Äôs private-sector workers, are hemorrhaging, and the loans are meant to help them retain employees or rehire those they let go because of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nBut business owners found that applying for the money was harder than they had anticipated.

Saudi Arabia had called for the meeting last Thursday, responding to pressure from President Trump.\\n\\nIn early March, Russia declined to go along with a Saudi-led OPEC proposal to further trim production to deal with the plummeting demand for oil because of the coronavirus epidemic, leading the Saudis to walk away from a three-year agreement with Moscow on production trims.

Avraham Eisenberg, a New York wholesaler who is trying to ship masks from China, compared the rush for masks to the fad several years ago for fidget spinners.\\n\\nThe Justice Department said last month that it would investigate people manipulating the medical-supply market. Five days later, federal authorities charged a Brooklyn man with lying about price gouging after he tried to sell 1,000 masks and other supplies to a doctor for $12,000. (He also was charged with assault after he claimed he had the coronavirus and coughed on F.B.I. agents.) Federal officials are now distributing the more than half a million supplies they confiscated from him.\\n\\nGlobal demand and stacks of cash\\n\\nIn China, the competition is intense. A small number of Chinese factories are certified by the Food and Drug Administration to make N95 masks, and ‚Äúthose are the diamonds right now,‚Äù said Lily Liu, a Chinese hospital executive turned Silicon Valley entrepreneur who now helps run Operation Masks.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening at those factories is France shows up in the morning, and then they get Germany at breakfast, and then Italy after lunch, and then the U.S. in the afternoon,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIn between they get distributors showing up at their doorstep with stacks of cash.‚Äù\\n\\nThat demand has fueled the spike in prices. While some factory owners are probably making handsome margins, much of the price increase is likely spread across the supply chain, from the firms that ship and inspect the masks to those that make the masks‚Äô fabric and the machines that assemble them.\\n\\nTake Zhou Hua, the owner of a factory in Xuancheng, China, that months ago made children‚Äôs clothing. In February, as the coronavirus swept across his country, he rushed to buy mask machines and spent roughly $500,000 transforming his plant. Now his staff has nearly doubled to 75 employees, and they make 1.6 million masks a day.\\n\\nHe said his margins were modest, and blamed higher material costs for much of the price increases. Most masks use melt-blown fabric to stop tiny particles. Mr. Zhou said the price of that material had risen 90 percent to about $53 a ton. He added that the price for machines that weld straps to the masks had tripled, to roughly $2,100.', 'author': ['Jack Nicas']}, {'link': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/business/the-week-in-business-grim-numbers-get-even-worse.html', 'published': '2020-04-05T11:00:09', 'title': 'The Week in Business: Grim Numbers Get Even Worse', 'text': 'Oversharing on Zoom\\n\\nIn this era of social distancing, you‚Äôve probably grown well acquainted with Zoom, the videoconferencing tool that millions of people are now using for remote work check-ins and virtual family dinners.

It‚Äôs too early to know if the drug actually works, and the research is inconclusive so far ‚Äî so it‚Äôs basically the medical equivalent of throwing spaghetti at the wall. But one thing is for sure: Social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are being used to spread claims of its efficacy, and some messages have gone too far. All three tech companies removed videos of a speech by President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil where he claimed that hydroxychloroquine was curing the disease. But with many experimental treatments flying around, it‚Äôll be extra tough for tech platforms to monitor for harmful misinformation.\\n\\nA Change of Plan\\n\\nRemember when WeWork made a disastrous attempt to go public last year and was bailed out by SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate? (Remember when people still went to co-working spaces?) Well, now SoftBank doesn‚Äôt want to follow through with its initial deal to buy $3 billion in WeWork stock from other shareholders, which leaves many of the company‚Äôs top executives ‚Äî including its much-maligned former chief executive, Adam Neumann ‚Äî holding the bag. WeWork‚Äôs board committee said it was ‚Äúsurprised and disappointed‚Äù that SoftBank was backing out of the share purchase, which is probably an understatement. It also means that Mr. Neumann, who has been widely blamed for the company‚Äôs implosion, won‚Äôt walk away with the millions he was originally promised.\\n\\nDeal or No Deal\\n\\nPresident Trump caused a record surge in oil prices this past Thursday when he tweeted that he was expecting an oil deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia that would end their weekslong price war. But Russian officials denied that any such negotiations with Saudi Arabia had taken place, and it appears that the deal might not actually exist. The combination of lower demand for oil and a falling-out between two of the world‚Äôs largest oil producers has wreaked havoc on the energy industry, although it has made gas much cheaper ‚Äî not that you may have noticed, since you‚Äôre (hopefully) staying home.

Stocks of the critical gear are disappearing during the coronavirus pandemic. Doctors say they are rationing gloves, reusing masks and raiding hardware stores. The C.D.C. has even said that scarves or bandannas can be used as protection as a last resort. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve met the doctors, and talked with them every day. I think there‚Äôs an interesting challenge here in that, currently, there‚Äôs such a need that if they had anything, they would deploy it.‚Äù The cries for help are mobilizing a wide range of innovators, some of them even joining forces through online messaging platforms like Slack. These are engineers, doctors and even high school students from around the world. They come from all walks of life, but say their goal is the same. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing because no one‚Äôs asking which country are you from? They‚Äôre just like, how can I help? What do you need?‚Äù They‚Äôre pitching in by crowdsourcing designs for masks, face shields and even ventilators that could be reproduced around the world. This is Nick Moser. He‚Äôs an active player in one of the maker groups. His day job is at a design studio. Now, he‚Äôs designing replicable face masks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focused on three products: a face shield, a cloth mask and an alternative to N95-rated respirators. The face shield is the first line of defense for medical workers. It protects against droplets. If a patient coughs, it‚Äôll hit the face shield rather than them.‚Äù Some designs are produced using 3-D printers or laser cutters. ‚ÄúThere you go.‚Äù Then, the prototypes are field-tested by health care workers. Even some university labs are experimenting with DIY techniques. A group at Georgia Tech is working with open-source designs from the internet to develop products. ‚ÄúMy lab works in the area of frugal science, and we build low-cost tools for resource-limited areas. And now, we‚Äôve realized that I don‚Äôt have to go that far. It‚Äôs in our backyard, right? We need it now. So this is a plastic sheet I have ‚Äî not too different from what you would get out from a 2-liter Coke or a soda bottle. I actually bought this from an art store. It‚Äôs just sheets of PET, so we can cut these out. We are calling this an origami face shield, and it‚Äôs the Level 1 protection. This is one idea. There are multiple different prototypes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis headband can be reused, and a doctor or nurse could just basically tear this off and basically snap another one on. We‚Äôre hearing that, in some cases, that they go through close to 2,000 of these a day.‚Äù Because the need is growing so rapidly, the makers are also thinking about how to increase their production. ‚ÄúSo how do we get from this one that someone made at home on a laser cutter or a 3-D printer, and then get it in the hands of thousands of doctors and front-line workers?‚Äù They‚Äôre working with mass manufacturers that can take their tested designs, and replicate them at a larger scale. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been on the phone talking to a number of suppliers, material suppliers. So I think one of the neat things that we‚Äôve done is not only the design, proving that you can make it rapidly, but then also trying to secure the entire supply chains.‚Äù This is Dr. Susan Gunn, whose hospital system in New Orleans has even started its own initiative to 3-D print equipment. ‚ÄúSo it starts with an idea. We put the idea into place. And then we make sure that it‚Äôs professional-grade first. Infection control is looking at it, and we‚Äôre making sure that we‚Äôre using the correct materials that would be approved by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization.‚Äù Dr. Gunn says the gear is a safe alternative for those who might otherwise face a shortage. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre creating face shields and we‚Äôre creating these different PPEs, and we‚Äôre putting them in the hands where people felt like they needed them.‚Äù Another critical piece of equipment is the N95 mask, and the supply is dwindling fast. Nick and his team are designing a robust alternative for this mask that can hold any filter material, and be mass produced. ‚ÄúIt is easily printable. This one is used in medical situations where there‚Äôs an actively infectious patient. So nursing homes or obviously I.C.U. units would be the target to receive these.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese are really hard objects to manufacture because you‚Äôre going to give it to a nurse, and then I want to be really confident that it will not let a virus through, right?‚Äù This equipment is not approved by federal agencies, but the designers are testing their respirator prototypes for safety. ‚ÄúThat was basically the first, almost the first question that was asked. Can we do anything that‚Äôs actually going to be safe and helpful?‚Äù Some makers are pursuing even more ambitious projects. An engineer named Stephen Robinson in New Haven, Conn., is working on designing ventilators to help patients breathe. Countries are facing a dire shortage of the lifesaving machines. Right now, these DIY ventilators are still prototypes. ‚ÄúSo really, this should be thought of as the seed of an idea that could potentially be grown with, and absolutely requiring, the medical and the tech communities.‚Äù But they could become key if critical supplies run out. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in very uncertain times, and I see explorations and projects as kind of an insurance policy that could potentially be leaned on if there was extreme circumstances.‚Äù Health care workers are hopeful that these efforts could prevent an even worse outcome. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want anybody ‚Äî let‚Äôs be clear ‚Äî to use a bandanna to protect themselves. I hope it never gets to the point where we have to wear a bandanna. And I don‚Äôt think, with this initiative that we will get there.‚Äù For innovators like Saad, the challenge is personal. ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt stop. I have to do stuff. And then I‚Äôm currently at a hospital. That‚Äôs why I have this uplifting little flower portrait.

It‚Äôs impossible, because we‚Äôre trying to juggle too much,‚Äù said Diana Graber, the founder of Cyberwise and the author of ‚ÄúRaising Humans in a Digital World.‚Äù\\n\\nHere‚Äôs the advice I was given.\\n\\n1. Communicate to your kids that digital devices deserve a special kind of respect.\\n\\nOne way to do this is to set the rule that kids have to ask permission to go online or use a device, much as they would need to ask permission before walking over to a neighbor‚Äôs house. ‚ÄúBy just pausing at that permission-getting, you‚Äôre already asking a child to be conscious about what they‚Äôre doing,‚Äù said Liz Kline, the vice president of education programs at Common Sense Media, an independent nonprofit organization that provides technology recommendations for families and schools.\\n\\n2. Consider setting rules on when and where your kids have access to devices or specific apps.\\n\\nMaybe they‚Äôre not allowed to use tablets in their rooms with the door closed, and instead have to use them in common areas. Perhaps they can do certain activities (like online reading) in their rooms but others (like chats and video chats) must be done in shared spaces, where you can check on what they‚Äôre doing. If that sounds intrusive, consider that when your kids have real-life play dates, you‚Äôre likely to pop in every so often to check in and offer snacks; digital play dates should be no different, said Devorah Heitner, Ph.D., the founder of Raising Digital Natives and the author of ‚ÄúScreenwise.‚Äù\\n\\n3. Create a schedule so that kids are using their devices during periods when you can provide the most oversight.\\n\\nIf you need screens to entertain your kids during the conference call you‚Äôre leading, that‚Äôs fine ‚Äî but maybe that‚Äôs when you start a Netflix show for them and take the remote control with you. In other words, set things up so that they‚Äôre least likely to get into trouble online while you‚Äôre distracted, said Dr. Heitner.\\n\\n4. Consider a technology agreement for each child.\\n\\nIt may help you organize and remember these rules. Here‚Äôs a sample agreement from Common Sense Media, and here‚Äôs one from Cyberwise; once signed, they could go up on the refrigerator. If kids break the rules, come up with appropriate consequences ‚Äî if they chatted when they weren‚Äôt allowed to, they might lose chat privileges for a while.

Coronavirus Solutions Are Gaining Steam', 'text': 'Health care workers around the world are asking for help. ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù ‚ÄúPPE.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen do you need it?‚Äù ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù They‚Äôre in desperate need of more PPE, also known as personal protective equipment. Stocks of the critical gear are disappearing during the coronavirus pandemic. Doctors say they are rationing gloves, reusing masks and raiding hardware stores. The C.D.C. has even said that scarves or bandannas can be used as protection as a last resort. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve met the doctors, and talked with them every day. I think there‚Äôs an interesting challenge here in that, currently, there‚Äôs such a need that if they had anything, they would deploy it.‚Äù The cries for help are mobilizing a wide range of innovators, some of them even joining forces through online messaging platforms like Slack. These are engineers, doctors and even high school students from around the world. They come from all walks of life, but say their goal is the same. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing because no one‚Äôs asking which country are you from? They‚Äôre just like, how can I help? What do you need?‚Äù They‚Äôre pitching in by crowdsourcing designs for masks, face shields and even ventilators that could be reproduced around the world. This is Nick Moser. He‚Äôs an active player in one of the maker groups. His day job is at a design studio. Now, he‚Äôs designing replicable face masks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focused on three products: a face shield, a cloth mask and an alternative to N95-rated respirators. The face shield is the first line of defense for medical workers. It protects against droplets. If a patient coughs, it‚Äôll hit the face shield rather than them.‚Äù Some designs are produced using 3-D printers or laser cutters. ‚ÄúThere you go.‚Äù Then, the prototypes are field-tested by health care workers. Even some university labs are experimenting with DIY techniques. A group at Georgia Tech is working with open-source designs from the internet to develop products. ‚ÄúMy lab works in the area of frugal science, and we build low-cost tools for resource-limited areas. And now, we‚Äôve realized that I don‚Äôt have to go that far. It‚Äôs in our backyard, right? We need it now. So this is a plastic sheet I have ‚Äî not too different from what you would get out from a 2-liter Coke or a soda bottle. I actually bought this from an art store. It‚Äôs just sheets of PET, so we can cut these out. We are calling this an origami face shield, and it‚Äôs the Level 1 protection. This is one idea. There are multiple different prototypes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis headband can be reused, and a doctor or nurse could just basically tear this off and basically snap another one on. We‚Äôre hearing that, in some cases, that they go through close to 2,000 of these a day.‚Äù Because the need is growing so rapidly, the makers are also thinking about how to increase their production. ‚ÄúSo how do we get from this one that someone made at home on a laser cutter or a 3-D printer, and then get it in the hands of thousands of doctors and front-line workers?‚Äù They‚Äôre working with mass manufacturers that can take their tested designs, and replicate them at a larger scale. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been on the phone talking to a number of suppliers, material suppliers. So I think one of the neat things that we‚Äôve done is not only the design, proving that you can make it rapidly, but then also trying to secure the entire supply chains.‚Äù This is Dr. Susan Gunn, whose hospital system in New Orleans has even started its own initiative to 3-D print equipment. ‚ÄúSo it starts with an idea. We put the idea into place. And then we make sure that it‚Äôs professional-grade first. Infection control is looking at it, and we‚Äôre making sure that we‚Äôre using the correct materials that would be approved by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization.‚Äù Dr. Gunn says the gear is a safe alternative for those who might otherwise face a shortage. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre creating face shields and we‚Äôre creating these different PPEs, and we‚Äôre putting them in the hands where people felt like they needed them.‚Äù Another critical piece of equipment is the N95 mask, and the supply is dwindling fast. Nick and his team are designing a robust alternative for this mask that can hold any filter material, and be mass produced. ‚ÄúIt is easily printable. This one is used in medical situations where there‚Äôs an actively infectious patient. So nursing homes or obviously I.C.U. units would be the target to receive these.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese are really hard objects to manufacture because you‚Äôre going to give it to a nurse, and then I want to be really confident that it will not let a virus through, right?‚Äù This equipment is not approved by federal agencies, but the designers are testing their respirator prototypes for safety. ‚ÄúThat was basically the first, almost the first question that was asked. Can we do anything that‚Äôs actually going to be safe and helpful?‚Äù Some makers are pursuing even more ambitious projects. An engineer named Stephen Robinson in New Haven, Conn., is working on designing ventilators to help patients breathe. Countries are facing a dire shortage of the lifesaving machines. Right now, these DIY ventilators are still prototypes. ‚ÄúSo really, this should be thought of as the seed of an idea that could potentially be grown with, and absolutely requiring, the medical and the tech communities.‚Äù But they could become key if critical supplies run out. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in very uncertain times, and I see explorations and projects as kind of an insurance policy that could potentially be leaned on if there was extreme circumstances.‚Äù Health care workers are hopeful that these efforts could prevent an even worse outcome. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want anybody ‚Äî let‚Äôs be clear ‚Äî to use a bandanna to protect themselves. I hope it never gets to the point where we have to wear a bandanna. And I don‚Äôt think, with this initiative that we will get there.‚Äù For innovators like Saad, the challenge is personal. ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt stop. I have to do stuff. And then I‚Äôm currently at a hospital. That‚Äôs why I have this uplifting little flower portrait.

It‚Äôs nice while it lasts, but it probably won‚Äôt end well.\\n\\nIn fact, according to contrarian analysis, this sentiment situation is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the wall of worry that bull markets like to climb. It‚Äôs more akin to the slope of hope that bear markets like to descend.\\n\\nConsider the bullishness that now prevails among the short-term market timing newsletters tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest.

N.C. (MarketWatch) ‚Äî When it comes to dividends, more isn‚Äôt always better: A company isn‚Äôt necessarily more attractive just because it pays a higher dividend.\\n\\nThat is the clear lesson I draw from the dividend-oriented newsletter with the best long-term record among the 200 services in the Hulbert Financial Digest rankings: Investment Quality Trends, edited by Kelley Wright. ‚ÄúHigher‚Äù or ‚Äúlower‚Äù for him only have meaning when comparing a company‚Äôs current dividend with what it paid in the past. He believes that comparisons with other companies are unhelpful.\\n\\nConsider CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, +0.55% , the drug retailer, and HCP Inc. US:HCP , the health-care real-estate investment trust. Wright rates CVS Caremark more highly than HCP, even though CVS‚Äôs dividend yield ‚Äî the annual dividend as a percentage of the stock price ‚Äî is just 1.6%, while HCP has a 4.1% yield.\\n\\nWright believes CVS is the better bet because its current yield is at the high end of the range of its past yields, which have extended from a low of 0.4% to its current 1.6%. HCP‚Äôs current yield, by contrast, is at the low end of its historical range, which has gotten as high as 12.4%. So, in terms of relative dividend yield, CVS‚Äôs is higher than HCP‚Äôs.\\n\\nHidden gems from the '70s\\n\\nOver the years, Wright has found that high yields come back down to earth and low yields rise back toward the midpoint of their historical range. That would be bad news for HCP, since a likely cause of its yield rising would be a falling stock price ‚Äî which could lead to losses that more than eliminate the benefit of the high yield.\\n\\nFor CVS, by contrast, Wright believes the path of least resistance is for its yield to decline because its stock price rises.\\n\\nTo be sure, CVS‚Äôs yield also would come down if the company cuts its dividend, which would be bad for its stock price. Wright therefore focuses his analysis only on companies with strong balance sheets and a long and consistent pattern of higher earnings and increasing dividends.\\n\\nThink before you grab those Ivy hunks\\n\\nSo how has Wright‚Äôs strategy performed over time? According to the Hulbert Financial Digest‚Äôs calculations, Investment Quality Trends over the past three decades has beaten the dividend-adjusted return of the entire U.S. stock market by an average of 1.2 percentage points a year ‚Äî while nevertheless incurring less risk.\\n\\nThat is a winning combination: The service is in second place for risk-adjusted performance among the three dozen advisers for which track records extend back that far.\\n\\nWright‚Äôs strategy is to be distinguished from the traditional approach to picking dividend stocks, which focuses on absolute rather than relative yield.\\n\\nOne popular variant of the traditional approach is the so-called Dogs of the Dow strategy, in which investors buy the 10 stocks among the 30 Dow Industrials DJIA, -1.68% with the highest yields. For example, the three Dow ‚Äúdogs‚Äù that currently have the highest yields are two telecommunication companies, AT&T T, -4.52% (4.7%) and Verizon Communications VZ, -0.99% (4.1%), and tech giant Intel INTC, -0.40% (4.1%).\\n\\nDespite investing in stocks with yields this high, however, the strategy has disappointed recently. Over the past five years (through March 31), it has produced a 5.0% annualized return, lagging the 5.9% dividend-adjusted return of the S&P 500 SPX, -1.51% and barely half the 10.8% return of a portfolio that is periodically updated to always contain just the 10 stocks that Wright recommends most highly.\\n\\nAnother variant of the traditional focus on absolute yield can be found in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. It contains the 50 highest-yielding stocks among the S&P 1500 Composite index that also have a long history of dividend increases.\\n\\nThe index‚Äôs two largest components currently are Pitney Bowes (the mail and document-services company, with a 10.0% yield) and biotech company AbbVie (yielding 3.7%).\\n\\nThough the performance of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index in recent years has been better than that of the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it still lags behind that of Investment Quality Trends. Over the past five years, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, -2.07% , which is benchmarked to the index, has produced an annual dividend-adjusted return of 9.2% through March 31 ‚Äî nearly two percentage points a year lower than the portfolio of Wright‚Äôs 10 most attractive dividend stocks.\\n\\nNote carefully that this Wright portfolio currently holds none of the stocks that are at the top of the holdings list for either the Dogs of the Dow or the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. In addition to CVS Caremark, the following nine stocks are in Wright‚Äôs portfolio: Air Products & Chemicals APD, -4.06% (yielding 3.3%), Archer Daniels Midland ADM, +0.93% (2.3%), Coca-Cola KO, -0.27% (2.7%), ConocoPhillips COP, -2.80% (4.4%), Occidental Petroleum OXY, +1.80% (3.2%), PepsiCo PEP, +0.58% (2.7%), Reliance Steel & Aluminum RS, -4.51% (1.7%), Texas Instruments TXN, -2.00% (3.1%) and Walgreen US:WAG (2.3%).\\n\\nThe average yield of all 10 stocks is 2.7%, versus 2.0% for the S&P 500 as a whole. And, even better, if Wright is right: These 10 have the potential to outperform the S&P 500 on a price-appreciation basis as well.\", 'author': ['Mark Hulbert']}, {'link': 'http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/nPEYyo38O6s/story.asp', 'published': '2013-04-01T10:01:19', 'title': 'Car companies stuck in slow lane', 'text': 'CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

(MarketWatch) ‚Äî The most cited bullish argument these days, at least among the couple of hundred investment advisers I monitor, is that the stock market will ‚Äúmelt up‚Äù as investors sour on bonds and transfer the trillions they have in fixed-income mutual funds into stock funds.\\n\\nI suppose it is conceivable. But a careful review of historical fund patterns doesn‚Äôt provide much support for this so-called Great Rotation argument.\\n\\nConsider the share of all mutual-fund assets (excluding money-market funds) that are allocated to either stocks or bonds. According to data provided by the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the equity share at the end of 2012 stood at 65.7%. That is only marginally lower than the 71% average of all comparable monthly readings since 1970.\\n\\nGiven that pattern, it is difficult to make the case that average fund investors are allocating an abnormally low share of their assets to stocks ‚Äî or that they are about to increase that share.\\n\\nOther mutual-fund data cast doubt on the Great Rotation as well.\\n\\nPaper or plastic? Dollar bills, that is!\\n\\nConsider 1987, arguably the period over the past three decades most relevant to the Great Rotation argument today. Then, as now, a bull market was getting long in the tooth. Beginning in April of that year, following more than 60 months in which fund investors had invested an average of nearly $4 billion a month of new money in bonds, they reversed course in a big way. Over the next six months, according to the ICI data, fund investors withdrew an average of $3 billion a month from bond funds.\\n\\nAs market historians recall, the stock market that year topped out in August, four months after that trend reversal. And the 1987 crash ‚Äî the worst one-day drop in U.S. stock-market history ‚Äî occurred two months after that. Far from inaugurating a new bull market for stocks, that reversal in fund investors‚Äô opinion about bonds came right before a major stock-market top.\\n\\nAnother reason to question the Great Rotation argument is that any positive impact on the stock market is likely to be short-term at best. That, at least, is the finding of a study, ‚ÄúMeasuring Investment Sentiment with Mutual Fund Flows,‚Äù published last May in the Journal of Financial Economics.\\n\\nThe authors found that even though the stock market often rises as investors shift assets from bond funds to stock funds, almost all of that increase is reversed within four months‚Äô time.\\n\\nThe Great Rotation stock-market melt-up hypothesis also would have to fly in the face of well-documented seasonal trading patterns. A study presented in December at the Australasian Finance & Banking Conference in Sydney, ‚ÄúSeasonal Asset Allocation: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows,‚Äù found that U.S. fund investors on average transfer assets from stock to bond funds during the winter months ‚Äî and do just the reverse in summer.\\n\\nAs followers of the famous ‚ÄúSell in May and Go Away‚Äù seasonal pattern will recognize, the implication of this new research is that the stock market on balance has performed better when the direction of fund flows between stocks and bonds is in precisely the opposite direction of what‚Äôs presumed by the Great Rotation argument.\\n\\nEven if a Great Rotation out of bonds comes to pass, it doesn‚Äôt mean investors will move all of that money into stocks.\\n\\nIn fact, they probably would put much of it in boring old money-market funds, according to Claude Erb, a former fixed-income fund manager at Trust Co. of the West.\\n\\nInvestors are reluctant to transfer funds between one asset class and another, Erb says. Since they typically consider money-market funds to be in the fixed-income asset class, money funds most likely would be the primary beneficiary of bond-fund redemptions, he says ‚Äî especially since the higher interest rates that make bond funds less attractive would make money funds more so.\\n\\nIf these patterns are any guide to the future, now might be the time to pull back from stocks rather than dive in. As Russ Wermers, a University of Maryland finance professor and one of the authors of the research presented at the December conference, puts it: ‚ÄúFor most investors, the more proper response to the fund flow premise of the Great Rotation argument is probably to reduce equity exposure rather than allocate new sums to equities.‚Äù', 'author': ['Mark Hulbert']}, {'link': 'http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/3FYsOI8GjSk/story.asp', 'published': '2013-02-06T12:30:38', 'title': 'Insiders now aggressively bearish', 'text': 'CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) ‚Äî Corporate insiders are aggressively selling their shares.\\n\\nThis is worrisome because corporate insiders ‚Äî officers, directors and the largest shareholders ‚Äî presumably know more about their companies‚Äô prospects than the rest of us do. If they were confident that the shares of their companies would soon be trading markedly higher, they wouldn‚Äôt be selling them now.\\n\\nYet selling they are ‚Äî at an alarming pace.\\n\\nConsider an insider indicator calculated by the Vickers Weekly Insider Report, published by Argus Research. The indicator is a ratio of all shares that insiders have recently sold in the open market to the number that they have purchased.\\n\\nFor the week that ended last Friday, this sell-to-buy ratio for NYSE-listed shares listed stood at 9.20-to-1. That means insiders of these companies, on average, were selling more than nine shares of their firms‚Äô stock for every one that they were buying.\\n\\nMutual funds take big bite of Apple\\n\\nThe last time a weekly sell-to-buy ratio was worse than this was in late July 2011, right before that year‚Äôs debt-ceiling debate began to spiral out of control. Over the next couple of weeks, of course, as the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs credit rating was downgraded, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.68% lost some 2,000 points.\\n\\nTo be sure, insiders have been selling heavily for several weeks now, and the market has continued to rise ‚Äî including the Dow‚Äôs eclipsing of the 14,000 level in recent sessions. This surprising strength in the face of insider selling has prompted a number of you to inquire how unusual it is for the insiders collectively to be such poor market timers.\\n\\nAs you can imagine, it‚Äôs not unprecedented. But it is more the exception than the rule.\\n\\nConsider where the sell-to-buy ratio was in mid-December, which is the last time I devoted a column to the insiders‚Äô behavior. For NYSE-listed stocks, the ratio at that time stood at 8.38-to-1. Read Dec. 18 Mark Hulbert column on insider selling.\\n\\nUpon reviewing the historical data, shared with me by Argus Research, I found four occasions over the last decade in which the ratio got this high or higher and the market continued rising for at least another month or two.\\n\\nOverall, however, the market fell. On average over the month following each prior occasion when the sell-to-buy ratio got this high, the broad market fell by 2.1% ‚Äî as measured by the Wilshire 5000 total-return index.\\n\\nIn any case, as others among you have pointed out, the high level of insider selling in December could very well have been caused in large part by the prospect of higher tax rates in 2013 ‚Äî which would have prompted them to accelerate their sales. To the extent this was so, of course, the high sell-to-buy ratio at that time would have been a false signal.\\n\\nRegardless, the sell-to-buy ratio today is even higher than it was in mid-December, and it can‚Äôt be discounted because of the immediate prospect of higher taxes.\\n\\nAll of which suggests to me that there is a distinct possibility that this time around, unlike in December, the insiders will be right.\\n\\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.', 'author': ['Mark Hulbert']}, {'link': 'http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/wPEX3LaXAsc/story.asp', 'published': '2013-02-05T12:01:27', 'title': 'How to pick dividend-paying stocks', 'text': 'CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

The service instead focuses more narrowly on the bluest of the blue-chip dividend-paying stocks, and recommends one of them only when its yield is near the high end of its historical range.\\n\\nThe service‚Äôs restriction to just the bluest of blue-chip companies is designed to avoid companies at which the dividend yield is only temporarily high ‚Äî firms that are about to cut their dividends, in other words.\\n\\nSpecifically, Wright puts a stock on his watch list only if it satisfies at least five of the following six criteria:\\n\\nHas increased its dividend at least 5 times over the last dozen years\\n\\nHas an S&P Quality Ranking in the ‚ÄúA‚Äù category\\n\\nHas at least 5 million shares outstanding\\n\\nHas at least 80 institutional investors\\n\\nHas paid dividends for at least 25 straight years\\n\\nHas produced higher earnings per share in at least 7 of the last 12 years\\n\\nThe service‚Äôs focus on relative dividend yield is a recognition that each company has a different baseline. A utility company, for example, may still pay a much higher dividend yield than other companies, even when that yield is lower than its baseline ‚Äî and when, therefore, it more likely than not is overvalued.\\n\\nHow has this approach performed? Over the last 12 months, for example, it has outperformed all of the major dividend-oriented ETFs. The average portfolio from Investment Quality Trends has gained 16.9% over this period, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest.\\n\\nBetter yet, this superior return was produced with nearly 20% less volatility, or risk ‚Äî which means its performance on a risk-adjusted basis is even better than the raw numbers already suggest.\\n\\nIts record over the longer term has also been impressive. Over the 25 years the Hulbert Financial Digest has tracked it, it has beaten a buy-and-hold by one percentage point per year on an annualized basis, while nevertheless incurring 14% less risk.\\n\\nInvestment Quality Trends currently is in third place for risk-adjusted performance over the last 25 years.\\n\\nWhich high-quality stocks are currently recommended by this approach? The following is Wright‚Äôs ‚ÄúTimely Ten‚Äù list of his top 10 current recommendations:\\n\\nThis package of 10 stocks not only has an average dividend yield of 2.6% but, Wright is convinced, has good capital-appreciation potential in the event of a continuation of the bull market, and healthy downside protection in the event of a bear market.', 'author': ['Mark Hulbert']}, {'link': 'http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/stWPJLBZcDU/story.asp', 'published': '2013-02-01T12:01:39', 'title': 'The 5 biggest investor mistakes of 2013', 'text': 'CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

Follow full coverage of Facebook‚Äôs quarterly results and conference call.\\n\\nDoes Facebook have its mojo back?\\n\\nThat calculation required just three inputs:\\n\\nFacebook‚Äôs revenue growth rate over its first five years as a publicly traded company. I assumed that it would be the same as the average of all U.S. IPOs between 1996 and 2005 ‚Äî 212% cumulatively, or 25.6% on an annualized basis (after excluding spinoffs and buyouts).\\n\\nFacebook‚Äôs price-to-sales ratio in five years‚Äô time.

The rate of return Facebook investors would require to hold the stock for the five years after its IPO. Generously, I assumed the market‚Äôs long-term average return of 11%. If I had assumed a higher return number, then the outcome of my analysis would have been an even lower fair value today.\\n\\nArmed with these three otherwise generous inputs, calculating a fair price for Facebook was a matter of simple math: As I reported last May, that price was $13.80. Read previous column: Facebook‚Äôs stock should trade for $13.80.\\n\\nHow can Facebook overcome this awful fate? Since investors won‚Äôt be happy earning less than 11% per year, and since it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect the company‚Äôs price-to-sales ratio in 2017 to be markedly higher than Google‚Äôs is today, the only realistic way for Facebook to overcome my dismal price target is for its revenue growth rate to be far higher than 25.6% per year through 2016.\\n\\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Getty Images\\n\\nYet the company has not shown that it can maintain this much higher revenue growth rate.\\n\\nTo be sure, it might on the surface seem otherwise. The company‚Äôs revenues for calendar 2012 were 37% higher than in 2011.\\n\\nBut, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who is one of academia‚Äôs leading experts on IPOs, the typical pattern is for a post-IPO company‚Äôs revenue growth rate to decline over its first several years after going public.\\n\\nTo average 25.6% over its first five years after coming to market, therefore, a company‚Äôs revenue growth in its first couple of years needs to be above that rate.\\n\\nConsider, for instance, the average revenue growth rate over the first three years after a company comes to market. According to Ritter, this three-year growth rate was 36.7% per year for the same sample of IPOs that produced a five-year annualized growth rate of 25.6%.\\n\\nSo Facebook‚Äôs revenue growth over this past year is almost precisely in line with the rate that was the basis of my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\\n\\nHow, then, is Wall Street able to persuade itself that Facebook should be trading at its currently high price? As far as I can tell, by assuming Facebook deserves to have a sky-high price-to-sales ratio ‚Äî not just now, but also well into the future.\\n\\nConsider, according to FactSet, the consensus estimate of Facebook‚Äôs revenues in calendar 2015 ‚Äî the furthest year out for which a consensus estimate is provided. That consensus is $10.5 billion‚Äînot that far off of what was implied by my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\\n\\nAssuming that consensus is on target, and assuming Facebook‚Äôs price-to-sales ratio in 2015 will be the same as Google‚Äôs is today, then Facebook‚Äôs market cap at the end of 2015 would be around $52 billion. That‚Äôs some 25% lower than where the company‚Äôs market cap stands today.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt like the conclusions of my calculations? Be my guest and go through the exercise yourself, employing any of the standard valuation metrics. And use your calculations to subject Facebook‚Äôs latest quarterly earnings report to a smell test.\\n\\nMy hunch is that if you do so, you will not be running out to buy Facebook stock afterward.\\n\\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.', 'author': ['Mark Hulbert']}, {'link': 'http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/WztdRhRt8IM/story.asp', 'published': '2013-01-25T16:27:45', 'title': 'Apple‚Äôs drop shows price of popularity', 'text': \"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) ‚Äî What investment lesson are you drawing from Apple‚Äôs breathtaking plunge over the last couple of months?\\n\\nThe one I think is most important is a contrarian one: To find your prince, you need to be willing to kiss a frog.\\n\\nFor years now, this contrarian lesson was dismissed by Apple AAPL, -1.43% investors, who racked up huge gains by ignoring contrarian analysis and instead investing in the most popular, coolest and best-performing company in sight. (Read blog post on the more than 5,000 mutual funds and ETFs that own Apple shares.)\\n\\nHowever, now that the stock is down nearly 40% since its peak of last September ‚Äî including a more than 12% drop in Thursday‚Äôs trading alone ‚Äî perhaps they will be more open to considering the contrarian wisdom of investing in out-of-favor companies.\\n\\nThe stocks of such companies may be less exciting, but over the long term they usually provide a superior ‚Äî and certainly less volatile ‚Äî return.\\n\\nJust consider a spectacular bet that Robert Arnott, chairman and founder of Research Affiliates, made in the summer of 2010. To set the context of his bet, Apple that summer surpassed Microsoft MSFT, -0.92% to take the No. 2 spot in the market-cap rankings ‚Äî and was fast closing in on ExxonMobil XOM, -2.94% as the largest publicly traded company in the world.\\n\\nAs contrarian investors know, sometimes you need to kiss a frog to find your prince. Reuters\\n\\nBP BP, -5.03% , in contrast, was on life support as it struggled to cope with the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Its stock price had plunged to its lowest in over a decade. Survival was by no means assured.\\n\\nLike the good contrarian he is, however, Arnott was willing to ‚Äúkiss the frog‚Äù: He publicly bet that BP would outperform Apple over the longer term.\\n\\nThat was a gutsy bet indeed. If you don‚Äôt believe me, take a look at the vitriolic comments my column received for merely reporting Arnott‚Äôs bet. Read August 2010 column in Barron‚Äôs by Mark Hulbert: Is Apple‚Äôs market value too big for comfort?\\n\\nTo be sure, Arnott‚Äôs bet only recently became a winner. But he is today enjoying the last laugh: Since BP‚Äôs low in the summer of 2010, it has produced a cumulative real return of 77%, in contrast to 71% for Apple.\\n\\nThis isn‚Äôt the only time Arnott has kissed a frog. Another came a year after his BP-over-AAPL bet: In August 2011 he predicted that Bank of America BAC, -2.62% would outperform Apple over the long term.\\n\\nAt that time, it was hard to imagine Bank of America‚Äôs reputation being more awful. It represented all that was dysfunctuional about bank and mortgage-company behavior that led to the credit crunch and liquidity crisis of 2008.\\n\\nEven today it is paying the price for its bad deeds: Its latest quarterly earnings, released last week, were hugely depressed by billions in charges related to the settlement of various legal disputes arising out of the subprime-mortgage fiasco. Read full report on BAC earnings.\\n\\nIs Apple a value investor's dream?\\n\\nYet on this BAC-over AAPL bet, Arnott is even further in the black than he is with his BP bet: Since my August 2011 column reporting it, Bank of America stock has produced an 18-month real return of 60%, versus 25% for Apple.\\n\\nTo be sure, contrarian bets like Arnott‚Äôs don‚Äôt always work out this nicely. But, more often than not, they do.\\n\\nWe know this because of the superior long-term performance of benchmarks like Arnott‚Äôs so-called fundamental indices, which almost always end up underweighting the stocks with the largest market caps.\\n\\nConsider the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index, which weights stocks according to a number of fundamental criteria rather than market cap. In the summer of 2010, for example, when Arnott made his BP-over-AAPL bet, Apple was the 27th largest company in that index. It would have been the second-largest company in the index if its weight had been based on market cap.\\n\\nSince the inception of the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index in November 2005, its alternate weighting scheme has added 1.44 percentage points per year to its return. That‚Äôs a lot of alpha to trace to changing each stock‚Äôs weight in the index.\\n\\nKeep that in mind the next time you‚Äôre tempted to invest in the latest fad on Wall Street.\\n\\nWhat frog might a contrarian be kissing right now?\\n\\nIn an email earlier this week, Chris Brightman, head of investment management at Research Affiliates, suggested betting on Wal-Mart WMT, +0.70% over Amazon AMZN, -0.63% . The latter company may not have the same pizzazz that Apple did in its heyday, but it still represents the allure and promise of the high-tech sector ‚Äî especially in contrast to Wal-Mart.\\n\\nAmazon‚Äôs stock is up over 50% over the last year, triple Wal-Mart‚Äôs stock gain of just 17%.\\n\\nBrightman‚Äôs contrarian-based reasoning: ‚ÄúToday, Amazon has a market capitalization of $124 billion, more than half of Wal-Mart‚Äôs $233 billion market cap. Yet Wal-Mart is more than five times the size of Amazon measured by sales, cash flow, dividends, and book value. Wal-Mart has free cash flow ... of $11 billion per year to distribute to its shareholders ‚Äî which is paid as $5 billion in dividends and $6 billion as share buybacks ‚Äî providing a nearly 5% annual yield.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúAmazon [in contrast] has only $2 billion of free cash flow and pays nothing back to its shareholders. Amazon‚Äôs sales and cash flow will need to more than quintuple relative to Wal-Mart to match Wal-Mart‚Äôs ability to pay its shareholders. Anything less, and Wal-Mart is the better investment.‚Äù\\n\\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.\", 'author': ['Mark Hulbert']}]}, 'marketwatch_stories': {'rss': 'http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories/', 'link': 'https://www.marketwatch.com/newsviewer/', 'articles': [{'link': 'http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B08621A0E-6CAB-11EA-8762-407E1360EFBA%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1', 'published': '2020-04-05T21:29:46', 'title': '‚ÄòYour boss is playing God‚Äô: My grocery store banned face masks for staff.

My manager told me to take it off. He said the company was following the CDC guidelines, which stated that masks do not have any affect in protecting us against the coronavirus.

We will have to act as a team, stay home if possible, and practice social distancing to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Your boss is not God, but given the risks to your health and peace of mind as front line workers, he is acting as if he is.\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that it‚Äôs changing its policy on face masks, and is now recommending that members of the public wear non-surgical cloth face masks to help prevent those with mild symptoms of COVID-19 or who are asymptomatic from spreading the virus. That is, the recommendation was made so the wearer doesn‚Äôt pass on the virus.\\n\\nNew York Mayor de Blasio said on Thursday that the public should wear masks, but not N95 medical-grade masks: ‚ÄúYou can create a face covering with anything you have at home right now, a piece of cloth. You can create your own version and put on your own decoration. That‚Äôs what we want you to do. Something homemade, not something professional.‚Äù Show your boss that.\\n\\nWant to read more? Follow Quentin Fottrell on Twitterand read more of his columns here\\n\\nPrevious studies have concluded that face masks have helped reduce contagion by reducing droplets being sprayed into the air during flu season; another Japanese-based study says this works when paired with vaccination, not an option in this case. It may be that they work in a small amount of cases and/or just wearing them helps to promote healthy behaviors.\\n\\nThis study says N95 medical-grade masks do help filter viruses that are larger than 0.1 micrometers (One micrometer, um, is one millionth of a meter.) The coronavirus is 0.125 um. ‚ÄúThese products can help block large droplets expelled by the wearer, but also have been shown to have efficacy at filtering smaller particles and are designed to fit tightly to the face,‚Äù it said.\\n\\nHowever, hospitals have reported a shortage of masks. I believe they should be used by medical staff who are up close and personal with patients who have COVID-19. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that there are only 30 million N95 masks in the national stockpile, and ‚Äúas many as 300 million masks are needed in the U.S. for health-care workers.‚Äù\\n\\nDispatches from the front lines of a pandemic: ‚ÄòThey‚Äôve likened it to a war where the number of casualties just keep on coming‚Äô: Italians find solidarity, resilience and music during the coronavirus lockdown\\n\\nAs to your question, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration states that such decisions ‚Äúmust be based upon a hazard analysis of the workers‚Äô specific work environments and the different protective properties of each type of personal protective equipment.‚Äù They are not designed or certified ‚Äúto prevent the inhalation of small airborne contaminants,‚Äù it adds.\\n\\nBut you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs a trying time. People are stressed out and scared. The U.S., like many countries, is waiting for a surge of hospitalizations, and there are real fears that the health-care system will not have the capacity ‚Äî or even the beds ‚Äî to deal with this escalating public-health crisis. This mask is something you can control, and now you are being told not to wear it.\\n\\nThere are other things you cando that are within your control: Wear latex gloves and, if possible, maintain a six-feet-or-more distance from coworkers and customers. Talk to your coworkers about approaching your manager (or the company HQ) to stagger the number of customers in the store at any one time. I have seen everyone from Duane Reade WBA, +0.99% to Trader Joe‚Äôs do this.\\n\\nI don‚Äôt blame you for being frustrated. I would feel the same way. You should be allowed to make decisions for you own well being. It would also be nice for your manager to show appreciation for the customer-facing staff on the floor. That includes you. A ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and an acknowledgment of how you are arguably putting yourselves at increased risk of catching COVID-19 would be a start.\\n\\nSo let me do what he did not do. Thank you for being there so people can get their groceries and stay home for as long as possible to help prevent catching or spreading this disease. Thank you for doing a job that requires more risks than many. It is appreciated. Hospital and ambulance workers are on the front lines of this crisis and, although this may not help you, they do have it worse.\\n\\nContinue to take all the necessary precautions, and stay healthy. We are all in this together. Millions of workers are likely to lose their jobs in the coming months, particularly in the hospitality and airline industries. This pandemic will have ramifications that will be written about in history and economic books.

(Something always happens.)\\n\\nAfter weeks of debate about whether members of the public should wear face masks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday evening that it‚Äôs changing its policy on masks. It now recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings, ‚Äúespecially in areas of significant community-based transmission,‚Äù such as pharmacies or supermarkets. It said asymptomatic transmission was ‚Äúnew evidence.‚Äù President Trump said he does not plan on wearing a face mask.\\n\\nNew York City is now Ground Zero for coronavirus. On Sunday, the state‚Äôs COVID-19 fatalities hit 3,565, up nearly 600 in 24 hours, surpassing the number of people who died here on 9/11. The number of confirmed cases in the state rose by nearly 10,000 overnight to 122,031. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that the state had not yet reached the apex of cases and deaths. ‚ÄúYou could argue that you‚Äôre seeing a slight plateauing in the data, which obviously would be good news.‚Äù\\n\\n‚Äú Coronavirus deaths here surpassed the number of New York fatalities on 9/11. ‚Äù\\n\\nPeople have longed for clarity on how to keep themselves and everyone else safe. On Thursday evening, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio went one step further and said all New Yorkers should wear cloth masks. ‚ÄúYou can create a face covering with anything you have at home right now, a piece of cloth,‚Äù he said. (Others say two layers of cotton or paper towels have enough density to protect against the virus.)\\n\\nLike Trump and the CDC, de Blasio said that he does not recommend using N95 masks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre advising New Yorkers to wear a face covering when you go outside and will be near other people. Let‚Äôs be clear, this is a face covering. It could be a scarf, it could be a bandana, something you create yourself. It does not need to be a professional surgical mask.‚Äù You know what‚Äôs better than a bandana, covers more of your face and stays in place? A balaclava.\\n\\nThis week, I went to a grocery store and I improvised in a balaclava. I looked like the Invisible Man if he had a walk-on role on ‚ÄúA Clockwork Orange‚Äù or ‚ÄúMad Max,‚Äù as a friendly commentator said. Here‚Äôs why I wore it: I wanted to cover my face completely so (a) I wouldn‚Äôt touch it, (b) I could protect others in case I was asymptomatic and (c) I could reduce my chances of catching a coronavirus-infected droplet. (You could also make a balaclava out of a cotton sheet or an old hat.)\\n\\n‚Äú ‚ÄòYou can create a face covering with anything you have at home right now.‚Äô ‚Äù ‚Äî New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\\n\\nCuomo told CNN‚Äôs Anderson Cooper Thursday night that ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt hurt from a public-health point of view‚Äù to wear improvised face masks to help stop the spread of coronavirus. Asked by Cooper whether he would follow de Blasio‚Äôs suggestion on face covers such as bandanas, Cuomo said, ‚ÄúIt could help if someone has the virus.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt hurt. It‚Äôs not exactly fashion forward.‚Äù That, of course, is the least of people‚Äôs worries.\\n\\nThere is evidence that some masks do work: Medical-grade N95 surgical masks, according to this study, filter viruses larger than 0.1 micrometers (a micrometer, um, is one millionth of a meter). The coronavirus is approximately 0.125 micrometer. Would my humble balaclava make a difference? I could be wrong, I could be right, as Johnny ‚ÄúRotten‚Äù Lydon sang. But I wore one. Given de Blasio‚Äôs statement on Thursday evening, I‚Äôm happy to give it a shot.\\n\\nWearing a balaclava, the most effective cloth mask I have lying around, is not something I did lightly. Growing up in Ireland in the 1980s during the Troubles, and living in London during the 1990s, sporting a balaclava with an Irish accent would have been a risky proposition. It has connotations that no Irishman would like to relive. But with my now transoceanic twang, I think I‚Äôll be OK. Plus, it‚Äôs for the opposite reason than Ireland of Yore: I want to stay safe, and help others do the same.\\n\\nMasks have helped reduce contagion by reducing droplets being sprayed into the air by the wearer. For the record, I would not wear a medical-grade mask. There is a shortage in hospitals in New York City, along with ventilators and other personal protective equipment. Here are some tips on how to make your own mask. Every day is Christmas Day in New York City: The streets are virtually empty. Every time I hear an ambulance I wonder if it‚Äôs coronavirus-related.

How about a jar of marmalade?‚Äô\\n\\nHere‚Äôs how to go grocery shopping ‚Äî without losing your mind\\n\\nNEW YORK ‚Äî One of my best friends in New York is self-quarantining. She requires a friend or two to shop for her. I am down with spending other people‚Äôs money and I like to be helpful, especially when the entire country appears to be waiting for the dreaded surge of coronavirus cases. For me, this is a win-win. Also, she has good taste, so her shopping list will have plenty of ideas for me. I just discovered homemade peanut butter. I will never go back to jars again. That‚Äôs a win-win-win.\\n\\n‚Äú `I love my adopted city, and I‚Äôm not going anywhere. I will ride this out. ‚Äù\\n\\nNot bad for a couple of hours‚Äô work. This task also gives me the opportunity to give people a snapshot of what it‚Äôs like living in New York City, the city that these days always appears to sleep. We are the national epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. I don‚Äôt have a yacht or a big pile in the country to retreat to. I love my adopted city, and I‚Äôm not going anywhere. I will ride this out. On that note, I have a 5-point survival guide for food shopping, which I hope is useful regardless of where you happen to live. So that‚Äôs a win-win-win-win.\\n\\nSo far, so good. We‚Äôre off to a good start. First off, here‚Äôs a little about my self-quarantining friend: She is smart, extremely well-read, and makes me laugh. We read long-form articles together and, afterwards, we discuss them over tea. We don‚Äôt always agree, which we like, but we do agree most of the time, especially on social issues, and we‚Äôre OK with that, too. She remains open to changing her mind. I learn from her, so I endeavor to remain open minded too.\\n\\nBarney Greengrass, the Jewish deli founded by the man who shipped smoked sturgeon to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Warm Springs, Ga. for Thanksgiving 1939.\\n\\n1. Look back, but stay present. A little perspective is good\\n\\nMy friend recalled the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 1990s, and how people would get up from a park bench if they thought a sick person sat down next to them. New York was one of the epicenters of that pandemic, too. She did not get around to talking about the many polio epidemics America has faced throughout the 20th Century. There are only so many plagues a person wants to recall over a plate of Dubliner cheese and crackers. Look back, but stay present. A little perspective is good.\\n\\nShe may be stuck at home, but she remains upbeat, and doesn‚Äôt let the grass grow under her feet. It‚Äôs humbling to witness. We take tap-dancing classes together (her idea). At least, we did until the social-distancing policies prescribed by public-health officials came into effect. On Monday, we each vowed to practice 15 dance steps. That‚Äôs more ‚Äúdig, brush, toe, heel, paddle and roll, paradiddle!‚Äù for me. Before tap-dancing class, she asks me, ‚ÄúSo, Quentin, what color is your tutu today?‚Äù I usually describe the most ridiculous-sounding tutu. ‚ÄúPink,‚Äù I say, ‚Äúwith yellow ruffles.‚Äù\\n\\n‚Äú If you‚Äôre nervous about shopping, imagine what it‚Äôs like for the staff. ‚Äù\\n\\nMy friend is 95, and she is now blind. Mostly, I feel grateful that we are both here in the same place, and at the same time, and that our paths crossed. She grew up in an Irish community in Massachusetts. I grew up in Dublin. She calls me ‚Äúlace-curtain Irish.‚Äù Because she is in a high-risk group, she is isolating. There is so much that is out of our own control during this pandemic, but this I could control: I could go to the supermarket for her. That is how I found myself with another Irishman ‚Äî who moved to the U.S. 30 years before I did ‚Äî at the Fairway Market on Broadway and 74th Street on Monday afternoon, with a shopping list in one hand and a grocery cart in the other.\\n\\nWe‚Äôd both been asked to help buy our friend groceries ‚Äî separately, it seemed ‚Äî so we joined forces. I didn‚Äôt like him usurping my place as Sir Edmund Hillary on this potentially hazardous expedition. Nor did I want to be Francis Crozier to his Sir John Franklin. (Neither Crozier or Franklin returned from their last expedition to the Arctic.) It‚Äôs sometimes difficult to ask one person for what seems like a big favor. It can seem easier to ask two people for slightly smaller favors. Regardless, this is the time to ask. I was happy to share the load. We made a good team.\\n\\n‚ÄúIf we get coronavirus, it will be in a grocery store!‚Äù I said, surveying the food aisles, and giving the gimlet eye to the scattering of other cautious New Yorkers wandering around in masks, pushing their carts. He looked at me like I was about to rob a store, not shop in one. I was wearing a balaclava I‚Äôd bought years before for a New Year‚Äôs Eve midnight run in Central Park. He tried to muffle a laugh. ‚ÄúWould you risk your life for a bagel?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúHow about a jar of marmalade?‚Äù I presumed that he was about to say, ‚ÄúYou are overreacting! He smiled, instead.\\n\\n‚ÄòGrowing up in Ireland in the 1980s during the Troubles, and living in London during the 1990s, sporting a balaclava with an Irish accent would have been a risky proposition.‚Äô\\n\\n2. St. Dalfour is delicious, but was it worth the trip?\\n\\nEarlier this week, I faced that dilemma. I was out of marmalade. I layered up and headed to Barney Greengrass on Amsterdam Avenue and 87th Street. This is the Jewish deli founded by the man who shipped smoked sturgeon to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Warm Springs, Ga. for Thanksgiving 1939. I bought a jar of St. Dalfour French preserve. I forgot they only accept checks or cash. I fumbled theatrically for stray dollars. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take your number,‚Äù the man behind the counter hollered, ‚Äúand bill you during the week!‚Äù That‚Äôs the New York I know and love.\\n\\n‚Äú Coronavirus survives longer on a solid surface like cardboard, steel or plastic. ‚Äù\\n\\nAfter that trip to Barney Greengrass, I got the idea for a D.I.Y. mask to help me and others stay healthy: My balaclava. The New York City Department of Health said in an online statement that face coverings are more useful for protecting others if you are asymptomatic. ‚ÄúA face covering will not protect you from infection, but it can help others. A face covering can include anything that covers your nose and mouth, including dust masks, scarves and bandanas. Do not use health-care worker masks, as those must be preserved for people in the health-care system.‚Äù\\n\\nI also wore woolen gloves to Fairway Market and Barney Greengrass because studies have found that shopping carts are covered in all kinds of germs, just like subway poles and turnstiles, or anything else that lots of people touch on a regular basis. I constantly lose my gloves, alas. But I have adopted a wartime thrift: Today, I wear odd pairs with pride. I did not bring alcohol wipes to Fairway. Next time, I will at least bring a few Clorox CLX, -1.20% wipes in a Ziploc bag. Before and after I put the groceries away, I wash my hands.\\n\\n3. Leave your ‚Äòcranky pants‚Äô in the dry cleaners\\n\\nCoronavirus can reportedly survive longer on a solid surface like cardboard, steel or plastic than on a pair of gloves. That‚Äôs good news for my gloves, but I still act as if the virus could find its way onto my gloves, too. Here‚Äôs the other reason I wore a balaclava to the supermarket: It‚Äôs not comfortable, it reminds me and other people that we‚Äôre dealing with a serious health emergency; it covers almost my entire head, and ‚Äî here's the science bit ‚Äî it provides a constant nudge to remind me: ‚ÄòDo not touch your face.‚Äô If you take anything away from this, take that.\\n\\n‚Äú My balaclava provides a constant nudge to remind me: ‚ÄòDo not touch your face.‚Äô ‚Äù\\n\\nShopping can be stressful under these conditions. It‚Äôs good to be a cautious ‚Äî and a smart ‚Äî shopper. I usually want to get in and out in double-quick time, but on this occasion I decided to be careful and take my time. What‚Äôs more, I enjoyed it. Everything I could have done to minimize my chances of picking up COVID-19, I did. I stayed 6 feet away from others, whenever possible, including my shopping partner. We did not go at rush hour. I talked to staff and other customers.\\n\\nEveryone is freaked out. I get it. That‚Äôs why I decided to leave my ‚Äúcranky pants‚Äù at the dry cleaners, which closed its doors shortly after Gov. Cuomo‚Äôs social-distancing policy came into effect. Friendly banter puts me and, I hope, others at ease. A nice woman recommended the London broil. ‚ÄúThanks for the tip,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take half a pound!‚Äù I may not know my broil from my flank, but I do have a pretty good idea where our weak spots are for the virus. I just have to keep my cool.\\n\\n‚ÄòI also met a neighbor outside. We stood from 6 feet away from each other. Love and gratitude is all around.‚Äô\\n\\n4. If you‚Äôre nervous, imagine how the staff feels\\n\\nIf you are concerned about going to the grocery store, imagine what it‚Äôs like for those who work there. They may smile and say, ‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù But they could also be thinking, ‚ÄòDo you have it?‚Äô I told every staff member I spoke to at Fairway, ‚ÄúThank you for working today.‚Äù They need to hear that. New Yorkers have read about the hospital naval ships arriving into New York Harbor on Monday. The sound of entire neighborhoods cheering for health-care workers can move you to tears. But not everyone is finding it so easy, and a frazzled customer is often not a gentle or happy customer.\\n\\n‚Äú Don‚Äôt drive yourself crazy reading social media: Fear is not your friend. ‚Äù\\n\\nI read peer-reviewed studies ‚Äî not mysterious Facebook FB, -2.53% posts ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt let them drive me crazy. There is still no evidence linking coronavirus transmission with food and food packaging, despite the virus being able to survive on cardboard in a laboratory setting. Furthermore, Juan Dumois, a pediatric infectious-diseases physician at Johns Hopkins All Children‚Äôs Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla., suggests that viruses would survive better on ‚Äúartificial fibers‚Äù ‚Äî polyester over wool, silk or cotton.\\n\\nUltimately, I choose caremongering over scaremongering because fear is not your friend. My self-quarantining friend told me the other day, ‚ÄúQuentin, I‚Äôm 95! Do you think I‚Äôm scared of coronavirus?‚Äù But that doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs standing in line at the supermarket, either. So here‚Äôs the deal: If you want to change clothes or wear a non-surgical mask, do it. If you want to wear a goldfish bowl on your head and fly around on rollerblades, while reciting ‚ÄúDe Rerum Natura‚Äù by Lucretius, be my guest. I‚Äôll be the first to tip my hat, and say, ‚ÄúGood morning! Have a shatterproof day.‚Äù\\n\\n5. You have to think on your feet during a pandemic\\n\\nI also got something I couldn‚Äôt buy at any store or pharmacy. Getting out of the house was a magical tonic. This was the biggest supermarket sweep of all: Turns out, my friend was doing me the favor, and I didn‚Äôt even know it. I did not see Yoko Ono rummaging through the vegetables at Fairway ‚Äî I did see her there once, and I left her to it ‚Äî but I did enjoy the fruits of my labor by feeling useful for helping a friend. I also met a neighbor outside. We stood from 6 feet away from each other. He works in a salon and he has been furloughed. New York is a village. Love and gratitude is all around.\\n\\n‚Äú Turns out, my friend was doing me the favor, and I didn‚Äôt even know it. ‚Äù\\n\\nAnd so to the last leg of my New Yorker‚Äôs survival guide to grocery shopping. We had two weeks‚Äô worth of groceries ‚Äî bottles, cans, six-packs of kitchen roll, liters of milk, jars of this, that and the other ‚Äî and they were heavy. Remaining vigilant for an hour in the store made it seem like two hours. We were exhausted from our shopping. I walked one block, and we had a few more to go. I spotted an abandoned cart on the street corner. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll return it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLater!‚Äù\\n\\nI quickly piled the groceries into the cart, and pushed it across four traffic lanes on Broadway. ‚ÄúGo! Go! Go!‚Äù I shouted, as we hurtled along. This was not a time for reticence. We‚Äôre in the middle of a national emergency, after all; if the cops stopped me, I‚Äôd simply tell them the truth. Thank you, NYPD, first responders and health professionals, and thank you, Fairway Market. I wanted to transport these goods without doing my back in. (You have to think on your feet during a pandemic. I now use walkie talkies as an old-school Generation X way of spatial distancing with friends in the park.)\\n\\nAs I headed down Amsterdam with the speed of a bullet, a man ran out of a jewelry store in pursuit of another man. ‚ÄúPeople are dying, and you try to steal something from my store? You motherf‚Äî!‚Äù Ah, yes. There are always folks with bigger problems than mine. I kept moving: This was a good day in Manhattan. To quote that opening line from Jules Dassin‚Äôs postwar film noir, ‚ÄúThe Naked City‚Äù: ‚ÄúThere are 8 million stories in the naked city. This has been one of them.‚Äù My 95-year-old friend would have been 22 when that film was released. She, too, has more stories to tell.\\n\\n(This story was updated on April 5, 2020.)\\n\\nThis essay is part of a MarketWatch series, ‚ÄòDispatches from a pandemic.‚Äô\", 'author': ['Quentin Fottrell', 'New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio']}, {'link': 'http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B690BD996-7753-11EA-88E8-167265D730BA%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1', 'published': '2020-04-05T17:53:32', 'title': 'Joe Rogan on why he‚Äôs set to vote for Donald Trump: Democrats have ‚Äòmade us all morons‚Äô by running Joe Biden', 'text': 'Joe Rogan, the comedian who earns a reported $30 million a year for his wildly popular podcast, isn‚Äôt a huge fan of Donald Trump, but it now looks like he‚Äôll vote for him in November.\\n\\n‚Äú ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt vote for that guy.

In addition to payroll grants, Congress also approved $29 billion in loans to passenger and cargo airlines as part of the historic $2 trillion coronavirus aid package last month. \"The intent of this program was very clear: keep America\\'s hardworking aviation professionals in their jobs through direct payroll payments from the Treasury Department,\" wrote House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and other top Democrats. \"We are concerned the Treasury Department\\'s recent guidance on the \\'Airline Industry Payroll Support\\' Program does not fully reflect the intent of Congress,\" they wrote. ‚ÄîLauren Hirsch, Leslie Josephs\\n\\n3:50 pm: France\\'s death toll slows but coronavirus still hits hard\\n\\nFrance\\'s daily death toll from the novel coronavirus fell in the past 24 hours and admissions into intensive care also slowed, the health ministry said on Sunday, thanking citizens for largely respecting a lockdown to halt the spread of the virus.

Congress last month created the unprecedented program as part of a $2 trillion stimulus package to help businesses that have either shut down or have been dramatically curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic. Borrowers could apply for the loans via participating banks from Friday until June 30. The program is being jointly administered by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration (SBA). \"Community bankers are frustrated with failed technology links and portals. Even those banks with access to the (SBA) system have shared their experiences of significant challenges with user access and latency in application processing,\" the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) wrote in a letter to the Treasury and SBA on Saturday evening.

COVID-19 has spread on ships across nearly half of its brands, infecting hundreds of passengers and killing others. Shares of Carnival are down more than 80% in 2020 alone, and the company said in a securities filing that it couldn\\'t predict when any of its ships would begin to sail again or when ports would reopen. Yet, time after time, Carnival has proven resilient, despite seemingly insurmountable setbacks. The company has experienced everything from norovirus outbreaks to fires and capsizes, and it\\'s still bounced back after every crisis. Some experts say this time it\\'s different. For the moment, it doesn\\'t look as though the U.S. government will be coming to the rescue of any of the major cruise lines. The $2 trillion relief package excludes companies which are not incorporated in the U.S. and don\\'t have significant operations in and a majority of its employees based in the U.S. ‚ÄîMacKenzie Sigalos\\n\\n12:01 pm: New York governor sees slight plateauing in the death toll, but said it could be a \\'blip\\'\\n\\nThe death toll from the coronavirus in New York state has reached 4,159, up from 3,565 on Saturday morning, Gov.

The governor said there appears to be a slight plateauing in the death toll data but emphasized that the statistic could be a \"blip.\" Cuomo also said the state could be near an apex, though it won\\'t be clear for the next few days. There\\'s been a shift of cases numbers to Long Island while cases in New York City are reduced, likely a result of people traveling out of the hard-hit city to take refuge elsewhere. ‚ÄîEmma Newburger\\n\\n11:55 am: Demand for jigsaw puzzles is surging as coronavirus keeps millions of Americans indoors\\n\\nSara\\'s jigsaw puzzles Sara Salinas\\n\\nAs coronavirus sweeps the country and sends millions sheltering in place, Americans are increasingly spending their time, and money, on jigsaw puzzles. The majority of the U.S. population is now under stay-at-home instructions, and businesses across the country are sending employees home. In the face of what health officials warn could be months of widespread closures, consumers are snapping up the time-tested indoor games, depleting inventories and driving up prices. Gamemaker Ravensburger has seen U.S. puzzle sales soar 370% year over year in the past two weeks, according to the company\\'s North America CEO Filip Francke. Factoring in the recent surge, the company is averaging closer to 20 puzzles sold per minute for 2020. \"Puzzles are not a necessity, of course, but the consumer is clearly telling us that there\\'s a large need that we can help fill at these times,\" Francke said. ‚ÄîHannah Miller\\n\\n11:47 am: Michigan governor criticizes lack of national strategy\\n\\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer once again criticized the lack of national support and response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first-term Democratic governor, who President Donald Trump has belittled in recent weeks, said the \"patchwork\" policies that put much responsibility of state governments could prolong the pandemic. \"Not having a national strategy where there is one policy for the country as opposed to a patchwork based on whomever the governor is, is something that I think is creating a more porous situation where COVID-19 will go longer, more people will grow sick and sadly more lives may get be lost,\" she told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Whitmer, who Trump last month referenced as a \"half\" wit, said if there was a national strategy, \"it would be better for us in the long run.\" Michigan, specifically Detroit, has rapidly become a hot spot for COVID-19. As of Saturday, the state had 14,225 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including 540 deaths. Whitmer said many hospitals in Southeast Michigan, where Detroit is located, are already at-capacity and running low on personal protective equipment for employees. \"Michigan is a hot spot,\" she said. \"We need assistance and I\\'m grateful for any partnership at the federal level or any partnerships with businesses that want to help out because we desperately need PPE. Lives are on the line here.\" ‚ÄîMichael Wayland\\n\\n11:38 am: Fed\\'s James Bullard says US economy is not in a \\'free fall\\'\\n\\nSt. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard pushed back against the suggestion that the U.S. economy and the jobs market are in a \"free fall\" on CBS\\'s \"Face the Nation.\" \"We\\'re asking people to stay home to invest in national health, and we\\'re asking them to use the unemployment insurance program in order to get the transfers they need to be able to pay bills while they\\'re at home, while they\\'re not able to work because health authorities are trying to get the virus under control,\" Bullard said. In fact, the 10 million jobless claims in the last weeks can \"in some ways\" be seen positively, he said. \"It means you\\'re getting the transfers to the people that are being disrupted by this health shutdown,\" Bullard argued. \"There\\'s nothing wrong with the economy itself. The economy was actually doing quite well going into this health situation.\" The Fed\\'s St. Louis district in late March predicted the U.S. unemployment rate could rise to more than 30% as a result of the coronavirus, a figure higher than what was seen during the Great Depression. ‚ÄîKevin Stankiewicz\\n\\n11:31 am: For a city in lockdown, two minutes of rambunctious joy to give thanks to frontline workers\\n\\nBetween the incessant screams of ambulance sirens rushing new patients to hospitals all day, and the non-stop negative news headlines, there is one moment each day in New York City that breaks up the daily monotony that is the new normal. At 7 p.m. each night, New Yorkers open a window, or step out onto balconies or rooftops and make some noise for two minutes. We scream, we clap, we bang pots and pans, we make music, but most of all we give thanks and gratitude to all the frontline workers who are risking their lives every day. It is an emotional and powerful moment to see and feel New Yorkers come together as one to reassure each other that we will get through this. It is a moment where those who feel powerless can show their gratitude to all the health-care workers, delivery drivers, grocery store workers and everyone else who is out there, every day, in the thick of it. My kids and I look forward to these two minutes because there are no negative headlines, there are no sirens blaring. There are just New Yorkers united together to see this through. ‚ÄîAdam Jeffrey\\n\\n11:09 am: Spain\\'s coronavirus death toll rises by 674 but the pace keeps slowing\\n\\nThe rate of new coronavirus infections and deaths in Spain slowed again as the country, suffering from one of the world\\'s worst outbreaks of the pandemic, began its fourth week under a near-total lockdown. Deaths from the highly infectious COVID-19 respiratory disease rose to 12,418 on Saturday ‚Äî the second-highest worldwide after Italy. However, the toll of 674 people who died during the past 24 hours was down from Saturday\\'s 809 and well below Thursday\\'s daily record of 950, the Health Ministry said.

The 93-year-old monarch is expected to acknowledge the suffering that many families have experienced because of the COVID-19 crisis, which has infected more than 42,000 people in the U.K. and killed at least 4,313 of them. She will seek to lift spirits and offer hope to the country in its hour of need. \"I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time,\\'\\' she plans to say, according to excerpts released ahead of remarks that were being broadcast Sunday night. \"A time of disruption in the life of our country; a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.\" The queen will laud Britain\\'s beloved National Health Service and others in essential services, together with around 750,000 people who volunteered to help the vulnerable. \"I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. Those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any,\\'\\' she plans to say, according to excerpts. \"That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet, good-humored resolve, and of fellow feeling still characterize this country.\" ‚ÄîAssociated Press\\n\\n10:50 am: New York fashion icons embrace New York governor\\'s mask challenge\\n\\nProtective masks for sale are displayed in a store in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn on April 2, 2020 in New York City.

Trump last week predicted that the U.S. could see between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths from COVID-19 before the outbreak is under control, echoing forecasts from White House health advisor Anthony Fauci. \"If we do the social distancing properly, we should be able to get out of this with a death number well short of that,\" Gates told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. He said it\\'s \"very important\" those figures are out there so people understand the severity of the situation. ‚ÄîMichael Wayland\\n\\n10:37 am: Biden says Navy captain who warned of ship outbreak should receive commendation\\n\\nCaptain Brett Crozier addresses the crew for the first time as commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt during a change of command ceremony on the ship\\'s flight deck in San Diego, California, U.S. November 1, 2019.

Brett Crozier, wrote a letter earlier this week to military leadership asking for help with a coronavirus outbreak on the warship. The letter, which was dated March 30, was sent via nonsecure unclassified email and also outside the chain of command. The letter was later leaked to the media. Trump, in a press conference Saturday, called the captain\\'s letter \"terrible\" and backed the decision to relieve the officer of his command. ‚ÄîSpencer Kimball, Will Feuer\\n\\n10:27 am: Illinois is nearing its coronavirus peak, governor says\\n\\nIllinois Gov.

Pritzker added the state believes it needs \"a few thousand more\" ventilators than it has now, potentially up to 4,000. \"That\\'s what we\\'ve asked the federal government for,\" he said.

Jay Inslee said his state has had some success in \"flattening the curve\" of new cases by acting early and aggressively with a stay-at-home order. Inslee called for a national stay-at-home order, saying it is \"ludicrous\" that President Donald Trump and the federal government have not done more to mobilize a national effort to fight the outbreak. \"I think it would be good to have national stay-at-home order and the reason is even if Washington does get on top of this fully, if another state doesn\\'t it can come back and come across our borders two months from now,\" Insee told NBC\\'s Meet The Press.

The number of new cases appears to be leveling off, likely due to the country\\'s aggressive lockdown measures. But health officials warn that Italy has not reached its peak as the death toll continues to increase. The prime minister said he doesn\\'t know when the lockdown will end because he is following guidance from scientists. \"Our response may not be perfect, but we have acted in the best of our knowledge,\" he said. \"The results so far indicate we are on the right path.\" ‚ÄîEmma Newburger\\n\\n10:04 am: Louisiana may reach ventilator capacity Thursday, governor says\\n\\nLouisiana Gov.

However, with the virus continuing to spread, many may wonder how they can best protect themselves from getting sick if they do need to go shopping. Consumers should first evaluate their own risk level for catching the virus before deciding to visit a grocery store, according to Karen Hoffmann, a registered nurse and the immediate past president of The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. Those who are highly immunosuppresed, have cancer, are on certain medications or are over the age of 65, should consider other options such as buying online or having someone else shop for them, according to Hoffmann. Before visiting the store, shoppers should also have a solid plan of what they\\'re going to buy and prioritize what they they need. \"People should try to think in terms of buying at least two weeks\\' worth so they can minimize the number of trips that they\\'re actually taking to the grocery store,\" Hoffmann said. ‚ÄîHannah Miller\\n\\n8:45 am: Pharmacies in New York City struggle to keep key medications stocked amid coronavirus outbreak\\n\\nAs tens of thousands of people test positive in New York City and many more show symptoms and are presumed to have the virus, communities are turning to their neighborhood pharmacies for prescription and over-the-counter medicines to alleviate their symptoms. The unprecedented demand created by the global pandemic is creating shortages for even basic over-the-counter drugs like Tylenol, as supply chains strain from the manufacturers that produce the medications to the wholesalers that deliver them to pharmacies, making it extraordinarily difficult to keep shelves fully stocked for key items in hot zones like New York. \"I never thought a pharmacy in the 21st century can run out of essentials, the most basic medications,\" said Emanuel Simhayev, a pharmacist in Astoria, Queens. \"When you face this hardship you cannot really help much.

Getty Images\\n\\nThere hasn\\'t been much to smile about when evaluating the recent jobs data in the U.S., with millions heading for the unemployment lines and the immediate future offering little hope. Even the one positive glimmer that came from Friday\\'s nonfarm payrolls report just showed how bad things have gotten. Average hourly earnings rose 3.1% in March from a year ago, a touch better than expected and seemingly a continuation of a general upward trend that started in November 2017. Earnings growth has stayed at 3% or better every month since August 2018. However, the primary reason the number looked good was because so many low-wage numbers were laid off during the month, painting a skewed picture that did not reflect just how bad of a period it was for service workers in particular. Of the 701,000 workers who lost their jobs during the month, 459,000 came from leisure and hospitality, mostly from bars and restaurants, according to the Labor Department. That made the wage bump mostly artificial and not representative of what workers are experiencing.\\n\\n\"That is a very misleading number. It\\'s caused by the sheer elimination of low-wage jobs,\" said Dan Alpert, a Cornell Law School professor and developer of the Jobs Quality Index, which measures not just job creation but the proportion of high-paying versus low-paying hires and layoffs. \"An increase in average hourly wages due to the fact that you\\'re losing people at the bottom is not a good indicator.\" The index had been showing a trend where lower-end jobs were disappearing faster. In March, the gauge indicated that more than 93% of the positions lost paid below the median weekly wage for all production and non-supervisor positions. Consequently, the wage numbers for March and likely subsequent months won\\'t be reliable gauges for the job market\\'s health. In fact, a number of data points that economists, Wall Streeters and the public watch won\\'t paint a true picture of what\\'s happening. \"You\\'ve got a lot of strange data points in this report,\" Alpert said. \"This is the tip of the iceberg in terms of the overall loss of jobs.\"\\n\\nWorse numbers ahead\\n\\nIndeed, even a spike in the headline unemployment rate from 3.5% to 4.4% didn\\'t reflect the true jump in joblessness. That number doesn\\'t include those not looking for work, so it didn\\'t reflect the 1.6 million workers who left the labor force. A large reason for that move was because many workers were restricted in their movements due to social distancing policies put in place to combat the coronavirus spread. A more accurate representation came from a separate measure that includes discouraged workers as well as those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons. That number lurched from 7% to 8.7% and will bear closer watching in the coming months rather than the headline figure that the government focuses on in its monthly report. Moreover, the true job loss in March was not even remotely reflected by the number the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday. The count sampled the week ending March 12, which was before the move to social distancing intensified. Coming after consecutive weeks that totaled 10 million first-time filings for unemployment insurance, the March report only scratched the surface. The release next month could show as many as 13 million jobs lost and the bad news won\\'t stop there, said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings. \"We had expected a total of 16.5 million jobs lost by May, but jobs losses are coming at a faster pace and sooner than we initially thought,\" Bovino said. \"Unfortunately, it could be much deeper, and while once unthinkable, we now expect a total of well over 20 million jobs lost by May. While hard to comprehend, it\\'s becoming very real.\"', 'author': ['Jeff Cox']}, {'link': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/05/coronavirus-lawmakers-urge-mnuchin-against-onerous-airline-aid-conditions.html', 'published': '2020-04-05T20:00:52', 'title': \"Democratic lawmakers urge Mnuchin against 'unreasonable conditions' on airline coronavirus aid\", 'text': 'American Airlines passenger planes crowd a runway where they are parked due to flight reductions to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at Tulsa International Airport in Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S. March 23, 2020.\\n\\nLeading congressional Democrats on Sunday urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to quickly reach agreements and not place onerous conditions on $25 billion in payroll grants for airlines reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nMnuchin last month said taxpayers must be \"compensated\" for aid given to airlines.

The pandemic has basically shut down the cruise-ship business, with the three largest publicly traded cruise companies suspending some, if not all, of their operations. Carnival, the world\\'s largest cruise operator, has been at the heart of the industry\\'s struggle against the coronavirus. COVID-19 has spread on ships across nearly half of its brands, infecting hundreds of passengers and killing others. Shares of Carnival are down more than 80% in 2020 alone, and the company said in a securities filing that it couldn\\'t predict when any of its ships would begin to sail again or when ports would reopen. Yet, time after time, Carnival has proven resilient, despite seemingly insurmountable setbacks. The company has experienced everything from norovirus outbreaks to fires and capsizes, and it\\'s still bounced back after every crisis. Some experts say this time it\\'s different.\\n\\nIn over 30 years, it\\'s unprecedented. We\\'ve never seen these types of warnings really ever. Stewart Chiron Cruise Industry Expert\\n\\nFor one thing, the government has effectively temporarily cancelled an entire industry. The State Department has advised that no American should set foot on a cruise ship. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which typically issues health warnings about certain regions of the world, not forms of transportation, has warned travelers against all cruise travel worldwide. \"In over 30 years, it\\'s unprecedented. We\\'ve never seen these types of warnings really ever,\" said cruise industry expert Stewart Chiron. Also different this time around ‚Äî unlike past viral outbreaks aboard ships ‚Äî passengers have been forced to quarantine on an unprecedented scale either in their rooms on the ships or at U.S. military bases after disembarking. Carnival is rapidly hemorrhaging money, and so far, the U.S. government has made it clear that it won\\'t be helping to bail them out. The question now: Is Carnival too big to fail?\\n\\nWhy Carnival keeps rebounding\\n\\nShares of the three largest publicly traded cruise line companies ‚Äî Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian ‚Äî are all down more than 80% so far this year, putting the valuations of the big three at multiyear lows. Carnival and Royal Caribbean did not respond to CNBC\\'s requests for comment, and Norwegian declined to comment. Carnival is no stranger to calamity, and when its stock price has taken a hit, it has shown it can recover. Over the years, the company has faced every disaster you can envision, from viral outbreaks, to colliding ships, flooding, and fires. But perhaps its two biggest scars are the sinking of the Costa Concordia off the Italian coast in 2012, killing 32 passengers, and an engine-room fire that left the Carnival Triumph without power for days, causing toilets to backup and human waste to overflow into rooms and hallways. That so-called \"poop cruise\" gripped global media.\\n\\nKyle Walsh\\n\\nCarnival wasn\\'t defeated. It sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into upgrading its systems across the fleet, and it gave the Carnival Triumph its own $200 million makeover, plus a new name. After each one of these crises, Carnival\\'s stock mostly rebounded. Lately, things haven\\'t been looking quite as good for Carnival\\'s stock. It has been steadily declining since 2018 and began 2020 at a lower share price than in 2016. On Tuesday, Carnival announced it would suspend dividend payments. Credit rating agency S&P downgraded Carnival on March 13 and says it\\'s continuing to monitor the company for further downgrades.\\n\\nThe fundamentals\\n\\nDespite the onslaught of bad news, Carnival still dominates the market. It is the world\\'s largest cruise operator, accounting for nearly 50% of all cruise passengers. It also enjoys a stronger balance sheet than its rivals. Until the outbreak of COVID-19, sales for Carnival had been strong, rising every year since 2015, and up more than 10% from fiscal year 2018 to 2019. That\\'s nearly double the revenue of Royal Caribbean and more than three times Norwegian\\'s sales in fiscal year 2019. Net profit also dwarfs the competition, though the company has been struggling to maintain growth. Carnival\\'s long-term viability ahead of the outbreak was also promising. As of the end of fiscal year 2019, Carnival\\'s debt-to-equity ratio, a measure used to help evaluate a company\\'s risk, was 45.3%, which is considered a good balance between what it owes and what it owns. Compare that to its two chief rivals. Norwegian and Royal Caribbean\\'s debt-to-equity ratios are around 100%. Both took on a lot of debt, at a time when debt was cheap, which may prove difficult to pay back during a rough patch like this. Carnival has its own debt payments coming due, not to mention the fresh injection of new debt it took on last week, and the $4.8 billion it\\'s committed to spending on new ships in 2020. On top of the $518 million in cash it already had on hand, Carnival tapped its entire $3 billion credit facility, and it is trying to raise over $6 billion in stock and debt. However, Carnival said it needs about $1 billion a month to keep operating, according to an April 3 securities filing. Getting credit investors on board comes at great cost to the company. The bulk of this new financing is from bonds paying investors 11.5%, an interest rate typically seen in the junk bond market. \"The cost of financing was particularly onerous, given this is an investment-grade entity with a substantial amount of collateral coverage,\" said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital. \"Its collateral coverage is 86 vessels, plus intellectual property, with a net book value north of $28 billion. Historically, this would give a huge amount of confidence.\"\\n\\nThe future\\n\\nSome have compared the current plight of the cruise industry to that of the airlines, when the government closed airports following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. Travel demand tanked, and several major American airlines declared bankruptcy, despite receiving federal aid. For the moment, it doesn\\'t look as though the U.S. government will be coming to the rescue of any of the major cruise lines. The $2 trillion relief package excludes companies which are not incorporated in the U.S. and don\\'t have significant operations in and a majority of its employees based in the U.S. Carnival, for example, is headquartered in Miami, its shares trade on the NYSE, but it is actually incorporated in Panama. Cruise lines also tend to hire foreign workers who don\\'t always fall under the protection of American minimum wage requirements. Industry experts think that, unlike past outbreaks, COVID-19 will fundamentally alter the cruising model.\\n\\nAn image of Carnival Splendor cruise ship at the Overseas Passenger Terminal in Circular Quay on March 22, 2020 in Sydney, Australia.

Cindy Ord | Getty Images\\n\\nOn March 6, New York City high school principal Matt Willie was already preparing for the worst. After watching a news report that said the city\\'s Department of Education was preparing to close public schools amid the coronavirus crisis, Willie texted his assistant principal: \"Prepare for the apocalypse.\" Willie said his school, University Neighborhood High School on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, was about as prepared as he could hope, having started disaster prep about a week before the DOE gave its final judgement. During that time, Willie and his staff took inventory of in-school laptops, surveyed students about whether they had devices and internet connections at home (\"just in case\") and had already distributed some laptops to students whose parents said they were no longer comfortable sending them to school. But when the DOE finally announced school closures, staff still had to scramble. The decision came down on a Friday, upending the school\\'s plans to ask students to sign out laptops from their third-period teachers. Instead, students who needed laptops came in on Saturday before the closure went into effect. They gave their information to a staff member across a 7-foot-long table to maintain social distancing, Willie said. Then, the staffer would retrieve a laptop and put it on a different table, where the student would pick it up and sign it out. In total, the school distributed 247 laptops, spanning roughly half its student population. Students, administrators, teachers and parents across New York City are dealing with a hasty transition to remote learning as the country\\'s largest school district has simultaneously become the nation\\'s epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Along the way, they\\'ve had to count laptops, fumble with muting group video calls and rewrite class schedules to fit around a computer screen. Interviews with parents and teachers across the school system revealed how students and staff are coping with the changes and the role technology plays in this new normal.\\n\\nUniversity Neighborhood High School Principal Matt Willie and Assistant Principals Rob Fox and and Kelly Powell served ice cream to teachers at the start of the school year prior to closures due to the coronavirus. Matt Willie\\n\\nA device for every student\\n\\nThe first challenge for many schools has been making sure each student has access to an internet-connected device. At Harvest Collegiate High School near Manhattan\\'s Union Square, math teacher Julia Shube said about 50 of 450 students initially said they\\'d need a computer, but once it became clear the school would move to remote learning, that number doubled. \"Even if you have a computer at home, you might have three siblings and you\\'re going to end up vying for that computer at some point,\" Willie said. When his school surveyed students, 85% said they had a computer at home but almost 70% said they would still like to sign out a computer if given the opportunity. \"That really signaled to us that we need to get ready to sign out every single one of our computers,\" Willie said. To supplement the 175,000 devices schools have already given out, the DOE said it\\'s working with Apple and T-Mobile to provide LTE-enabled iPads to 300,000 public school students without access to devices for their school work. The agency said on its website it\\'s receiving about 50,000 iPads a week from Apple. Its partners at IBM then set them to get them connected to the internet and activate appropriate content filters.\\n\\nTim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc. Getty Images\\n\\nAs of the first week of April, some students have still not received their remote learning devices, according to the DOE\\'s timeline. The DOE said its first round of iPad shipments began the week of March 23, first to students living in shelters, then focused on those in foster care and high school. So far, 13,000 devices have been delivered to students in shelters, according to a DOE spokesperson. Beginning Monday, the DOE will also focus on delivering to students who live in public housing, have disabilities or are multilingual learners. The DOE spokesperson said it will continue to deliver tens of thousands of devices a week until all requests are completed. Once students have devices, they need to be able to get online. Charter Communications\\' Spectrum offered free broadband and Wi-Fi to families with K-12 or college students in NYC for 60 days beginning in mid-March. But Willie found there were still a few students in his school who could not take advantage of the offer because they lived in rented rooms where they couldn\\'t access the landlord\\'s internet. For those students, Willie distributed smartphones the school had stored and instructed them to use them as hotspots. Some schools were even ready to resort to pen and paper. At P.S. 103 in the Bronx, teachers began making hard copies of work students could do on their own, according to pre-K teacher Katherine Myers. For Robert Schachter, a parent of an NYC public high school student and one in college, it was the non-technical tools that proved to be the biggest challenge. \"It was running to Walmart and buying two bridge tables,\" said Schachter, whose family is camped out in Texas with his fiancee and her two kids. They bought a new printer and divided all corners of the house so they wouldn\\'t be distracted by each other\\'s Zoom calls.\\n\\nRobert Schachter, a parent of an NYC public high school student and a college student, bought bridge tables so his kids could have space for remote learning while schools were closed due to the coronavirus. Robert Schachter\\n\\nTeaching over the internet\\n\\nOnce teachers and students have a way to connect to the internet, the next challenge is converting the classroom experience to a video conference. Zoom has made its service free for many K-12 schools around the world and removed its 40-minute time limit on basic accounts. That\\'s made it an easy choice for many schools that hadn\\'t been used to video conferencing, though the service has come with its own set of privacy concerns, especially since it was built as an enterprise product, not an educational one.\\n\\nA New York City student listens to daily lesson plan videos from her teacher as schools move to online learning amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Adam Jeffery | CNBC\\n\\nBut just because classes can convene over video chat doesn\\'t mean they\\'ll follow the same schedule as they did in the previous world. Four NYC public school teachers interviewed for this article said they find it most important to make sure their students are able to cope with the massive disruption to their lives. At Urban Assembly Gateway School for Technology in Manhattan\\'s Hell\\'s Kitchen, the week is broken up between formal instruction and tutoring. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, teachers have planned to post pre-recorded lessons onto Google Classroom, a free platform where students can find and submit assignments as well as take quizzes. Tuesdays and Thursdays are reserved for students to conference with teachers. \"It\\'s not the student that we\\'re planning for, it\\'s their family,\" said math teacher Kirk Schneider. \"We can\\'t tell them, \\'hey you need to be in math class at 10 or computer class at 11\\' because we don\\'t know who they\\'re babysitting.\" If the high school had tried to make students show up at designated times, lower-performing students would \"get lost in the flood,\" Schneider said. Instead, he\\'s noticed some struggling students are actually thriving with the flexible schedule. \"There\\'s some kids that are struggling in the classroom, and they\\'re killing it. They just needed a quiet place, they needed their own learning styles,\" Schneider said. \"Now I have a way to reach the kids that don\\'t necessarily want me there in front of them teaching.\" Schneider said he tries to be careful about when he posts work so it doesn\\'t get buried on the page. \"We can\\'t give these kids any more road bumps,\" he said. \"I can\\'t imagine how difficult these kids\\' lives are, I can\\'t make it harder.\" Shube, the high school math teacher, said some of her students are struggling keeping up with the influx of emails from assignments posted on the site, so she\\'s planning to do a lesson for her advisory students on how to organize their inboxes. It\\'s a whole different ball game for younger students, whose classes typically involve a lot more group interaction. \"I Zoom with small groups,\" said Myers, the pre-K teacher. \"They\\'re three and four -- the mute button on Zoom? I mean, come on!\" Myers said she uses Zoom calls to let students socialize with each other, grouping together friends and letting them talk freely while checking in on how they\\'re feeling. At the Castle Bridge School in Washington Heights, some parents asked teachers to open a Zoom meeting during lunchtime just so kids could chat with their friends, second and third grade teacher Liz Ciotti said.

In past days, he has taken on a new role as negotiator-in-chief trying to end the oil-price war that is endangering U.S. shale producers and hundreds of thousands of jobs.\\n\\nThis week\\'s result is an emergency, virtual meeting of OPEC leaders with Russia, Canada and Mexico. It was delayed from Monday until Thursday due to an ongoing Saudi-Moscow dispute about how to address the biggest collapse in global demand and prices since the discovery of the world\\'s first viable oil well in the mid-19th century.\\n\\nWhat\\'s decided at that meeting will say much about the limits to the leverage President Trump wields as the world\\'s leading oil and gas producer and with two authoritarian leaders in whom he\\'s invested so much ‚Äì Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\\n\\nIt was the bitter Riyadh-Moscow battle for market share since early March that had prompted a record two-thirds decline in oil prices to $19.27 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate, the lowest point since 2002. Yet Trump\\'s intervention with both men last week, as described to CNBC\\'s Joe Kiernan, had seemed to pay off.\\n\\nTrump said that he expected OPEC and the Russians to announce cuts of as much as 15 million barrels off the global total of 100 million. Markets rallied on Thursday and Friday to their biggest one-week gains ever of nearly 37% ‚Äì only for investors to wake up this weekend to continued Saudi-Russian sniping and the possibility of a renewed price plunge this week.\\n\\nWhat markets are missing in these radical swings is that a greater power than these three alpha males ‚Äì Trump, Putin and MBS ‚Äì is at work. They face the inescapable force of COVID-19, which for weeks and perhaps months to come will depress the global economy. April demand is thought to have dropped by more than 20 million barrels and perhaps by as much as 30 million ‚Äì a far greater sum than any cuts producers may announce this week.\\n\\nNever has the world experienced such a double whammy of demand shock and supply surge. In the end, it could be limits to global storage more than Trumpian intervention that shuts off the spigots.\\n\\nWriting in Foreign Affairs, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and energy expert Daniel Yergin calculates that \"virtually every available gallon of storage space in the world will be full by late April or early May. When that happens, two things will result: prices will plummet and producers will shut down wells because they cannot dispose of the oil.\"\\n\\nHowever this remarkable chapter in energy history ends, it\\'s revealing to study what was behind President Trump\\'s dramatic course reversal on how to approach the record decline of oil prices, which he on March 31st called \"the greatest tax cut ever given\" the American consumer.\\n\\nSome factors behind this U-turn were the persistent influence of 2020 electoral politics, the little-known role of former Energy Secretary Rick Perry and a threat to a Saudi-owned Texas refinery, and the lobbying power of the American energy industry (and some 2.5 million jobs it\\'s estimated to create).\\n\\nPresident Trump began to reverse course when confronted by aggressive lobbying by American oil companies and shale producers that he should apply more pressure on his Russian and Saudi friends to cut their production. His concerns grew further when confronted by the potential impact of energy company bankruptcies on U.S. employment and his own November electoral chances, particularly in Texas.\\n\\nMost intriguing, as the Financial Times reported Friday, a key individual behind the president\\'s apparent turn was former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was Trump\\'s energy secretary until the end of last year.\\n\\nThough Perry had established good relations with his Saudi partners, he advocated that the U.S. block Saudi crude from reaching North America\\'s biggest refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, which is fully owned by the Saudis.\\n\\nSpeaking to Fox News on March 31st , Perry said he would advise Trump to tell U.S.-based refineries to use only American-produced crude for the next two to three months. That would send a \"clear message that we\\'re just not going to let foreign oil flow in here,\" Perry said.\\n\\nShale producers had been lobbying the White House at the same time to suspend U.S. military aid to Saudi Arabia and impose further sanctions on Russian energy until the new countries cut their production. They also argued that the president should consider lifting some existing Russian sanctions should Putin play ball and back off his campaign to put them out of business.\\n\\nHowever, it appears to have been the threat to the Saudi refinery and to its overall relations with the United States which got Riyadh\\'s attention. When confronted by the possibility that Putin and the Saudi crown prince might not deliver on their production cuts this weekend, Trump upped the ante on Saturday and said he would impose tariffs on oil imports to \"protect\" U.S. energy workers from an oil price crash.\\n\\nThis would be a win for the smaller and mid-sized producers versus United States\\' oil majors, who have opposed punitive tariffs.\\n\\nAt the same time, President Trump may need to determine how he can deliver on Saudi demands for U.S. production cuts, lacking any direct ability to influence American producers. The two likeliest options would be a voluntary decision of the Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates the state\\'s oil and gas industry, or a shutdown of Gulf of Mexico platforms and their 1.8 million barrels daily, using the threat of coronavirus to their workers as the reasoning.\\n\\nThe uncomfortable fact for President Trump is that despite his long-standing criticism of OPEC and his support for free energy markets, he needs the cartel\\'s market intervention to keep shale producers afloat.\\n\\nPresident Trump doesn\\'t have good options. He lacks easy leverage over the players, domestic and international, and he\\'s got even less control over the COVID economic hit.\\n\\nIn the end, it is more likely that a US government bailout will save the industry, rather than a global market intervention.\\n\\nFrederick Kempe is a best-selling author, prize-winning journalist and president & CEO of the Atlantic Council, one of the United States\\' most influential think tanks on global affairs.

After all, streaming video usage would surely increase with everyone stuck at home with few other entertainment options.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t consider is just how dramatic the explosion of job losses would be, with more than 10 million Americans filing for jobless claims in two weeks and the unemployment rate jumping to its highest point since August 2017 in just one month.

Farzad Mostashari\\n\\nWhen Dr. Farzad Mostashari was the assistant commissioner for the New York City Department of Health in the early 2000s, he did something unprecedented. To keep tabs on the spread of disease in the region, Mostashari asked New York hospitals for access to a feed of their data, including the symptoms reported by some of the sickest patients. His team put together a website that collected anonymized information from emergency rooms across the state, and made it open for anyone to query. Nearly two decades later, on March 11, 2020, his work suddenly gained new relevance. The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a global pandemic, and predicted that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could kill more than a million people worldwide. Mostashari, who left his government role in 2013 to work in the health-tech industry, was concerned about the lack of information flowing out of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its departments at all levels of government have seen waves of staffing cuts over the past decade. State and local preparedness projects at the CDC received $940 million in 2002, but funding levels decreased by 31% in the subsequent fifteen years, one study found. But Mostashari\\'s website was still around, pulling in a feed of data from emergency rooms every day. So in early March, he started looking for incidents of patients complaining of flu-like symptoms that were outside the normal range for early spring. On March 4, he saw a spike in the data from New York that concerned him. For the next three days, he checked and rechecked the website to make sure it wasn\\'t a blip. By the fourth day, he knew something was wrong. \"Holy s---,\" he recalled thinking. \"Flu was going down, but patients were starting to come into the emergency department with a ferocity I hadn\\'t seen in 15 or 20 years.\" Mostashari sounded the alarm on Twitter on March 7, sharing several screenshots of the data, and stating \"we need to be working URGENTLY on expanding and protecting healthcare capacity\" in New York.\\n\\nData shared by Dr. Mostashari on Twitter. Farzad Mostashari\\n\\nOfficial reports said there were only 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York hospitals at that time, which seemed less concerning than in other early hotspots like Washington state. But Mostashari implored his followers to take the data he was seeing seriously. He said that with the detectable increase in symptomatic emergency room visits, New York\\'s health systems should reasonably expect a \"20x that burden of illness\" in the next month if drastic steps weren\\'t taken to stem the virus. Those steps came, but not quickly enough. It would be another two weeks ‚Äî March 20 ‚Äî before Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered New Yorkers to stay home and for all non-essential businesses to close. By then, the disease had spread to tens of thousands in the New York area and had started to overwhelm emergency rooms. Mostashari couldn\\'t wrap his head around why state officials seemed to be reacting so slowly. The website he developed for New York was just one of several systems that researchers at a state and federal level had built in the past few decades to predict disease outbreaks. \"The data is sitting there,\" he said. \"I\\'ve been pulling my hair out thinking this needs to be investigated.\"\\n\\nIt started with anthrax\\n\\nKen Mandl in the late 1990s when he was a junior faculty member at Harvard Medical School. Ken Mandl\\n\\nThe idea of developing an early warning system for public health dates back to the late 1990s, when the federal government was exploring ways to combat bioterrorism. Back then, Dr. Kenneth Mandl was a junior faculty member at Boston Children\\'s Hospital treating sick kids coming into the emergency department. Mandl had background in bioinformatics, which refers to the collection and analysis of biological data, as well as a medical degree. Because of that background, a colleague invited him along to a meeting with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, which oversees emerging technologies for the military. The meeting, which took place in a lounge at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology, quickly took a dark turn. Representatives from DARPA shared their concerns about a terrorist unleashing deadly bacteria on the New York subway. They described to Mandl how they had created some computer-based simulations to analyze the potential impact, including the number of deaths. \"They were like the men in black,\" he recalled. Through the models, DARPA determined it could reduce the rate of people getting sick if it had a real-time system to monitor hospitals for flu-like illness. After a person is exposed to anthrax, symptoms often include a cough, fever, body aches and fatigue. DARPA was afraid that doctors would chalk it up to a seasonal flu, and not order any further tests. Mandl and his colleagues started working on a system to perform the kind of surveillance that DARPA had outlined. Preventing bioterrorism was the major focus, but from the early days they had a hunch that the methodology could also be used to track seasonal flu, chronic disease, suicidal ideation and drug addiction, and even pandemics.\\n\\nBacillus anthracis bacterial colonies Media for Medical / Contributor | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\\n\\nIn 2004, Mandl and a small team of researchers produced a seminal paper on \"syndromic surveillance.\" It outlined how to use bioinformatics to detect a surge in flu-like illness at hospitals, which could point to anthrax or other deadly infectious diseases. \"We knew that every patient going into the hospital would be asked about their chief complaint,\" said Mandl, who is now the director of the computational health informatics program at Boston Children\\'s Hospital. \"Through our research, we realized that that alone was good enough for us to run entire surveillance systems off of.\" It was a heady time for the researchers. In the years after the 9/11 terror attacks, funding for syndromic surveillance increased dramatically. No one could forget the antrhrax-laced letters sent to media companies and congressional offices following the attacks. \"We got a big bolus of funding after the anthrax scare,\" said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE). \"When it comes to funding public health, money typically pours in after a crisis, and then it stops, and then starts again. It\\'s been a piecemeal approach.\" As the idea of syndromic surveillance gained credibility, Mandl and his colleagues were invited to large sporting events and other gatherings to help them protect against bioterror attacks. In 2003, the Greek government asked researchers from Mandl\\'s lab to fly over for the Summer Olympics scheduled for the following year. Ben Reis, a colleague of Mandl\\'s, went to Athens ahead of the games to get a sense of the \"baseline,\" meaning what a typical Tuesday afternoon in August looked like at an emergency room. He knew that the overall number of emergency room visits would be higher during the Olympics, so looking at the total number of people with a flu-like illness wasn\\'t enough. The more meaningful metric would be a spike in the proportion of total hospital visits attributed to flu-like symptoms. \"We learned that the ratios were more robust than the total number,\" he said. The following year, a team of local graduate students from the epidemiology department biked around to all the hospitals in Athens to get a daily record on an Excel file, sometimes on a floppy disc, and shared it with the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. In the end, their efforts weren\\'t needed -- the Olympics went down without a hitch, and with 9/11 fresh on everybody\\'s mind, many locals left town and tourists ended up staying home. But the research group began to realize their research could help public health departments respond to pandemics, another pressing concern at the time. In the aftermath of the SARS outbreak in 2005, Reis was invited to Hong Kong, where almost 300 people had died. Hong Kong had been a pioneer in rapidly scaling \"contact tracing,\" where officials tracked people down who\\'d been in contact with an infected person, then actively quarantined them. It took a lot of resources, but it worked to stem the spread of the virus. When Reis arrived, Hong Kong were still reeling from the recent outbreak, and its public health officials were willing to fund the system they wished they\\'d had during SARS.\\n\\nPedestrians in Hong Kong\\'s business district during the SARS epidemic, April 1, 2003. Christian Keenan | Getty Images\\n\\nReis argued that the methods they had used to monitor large events like the Olympics were applicable to pandemics. He described the concept of \"an epidemiological network,\" and suggested it wasn\\'t enough to estimate the total number of possible cases. Instead, governments had to look at the whole picture. \"There\\'s something called homeostasis, which is a fancy medical term that essentially refers to the balance of different vital processes in your body,\" Reis explained. \"We used that analogy to say that the public health system also has a normal balance between hospitals and disease categories that can be tracked. It\\'s not a matter of who\\'s in town, or if one hospital is overloaded at a single point in time, but it\\'s about understanding whether the relationship between those categories was out of whack.\"\\n\\nA public health upgrade\\n\\nKey members of the International Society for Syndromic Surveillance. Farzad Mostashari\\n\\nBack in the U.S. under President George W. Bush, the funding continued to flow to syndromic surveillance efforts. In 2003, staff at the CDC built out a federal system called Biosense to monitor emergency departments across the country. One of the early areas of focus involved tracking the seasonal flu, but eventually the database was expanded to survey a broader set of public health concerns. Other key projects that furthered the field came out of the International Society of Syndromic Surveillance, which was formed in 2005. The group, which counted Mandl and Mostashari among its members, hosted regular conventions to discuss ideas and share research. One of the better-known initiatives was Distribute, which involved asking states to share data on flu-like illness and other syndromes on a daily basis publicly for anyone to query. Some members of the group jokingly referred to themselves as \"the disease hunters.\" Not everyone was comfortable with the federal government\\'s oversight of these programs. Some hospital executives did not want to share information so directly with the federal government and bypass the states, and in the end fewer than 10% agreed to contribute emergency department data to the Biosense program. Epidemiologists at the CDC had to rely on data from government sources, including the Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Defense\\'s hospitals. Officials at the agency acknowledged these shortcomings by 2007, noting in an interview with \"The Scientist\" that the program lacked real-time capability and was built more for a bioterror attack than for public health. Then, in 2009, Biosense got a big boost. Taha Kass-Hout, an energetic cardiologist and data scientist, joined the CDC as a director of health informatics. Kass-Hout\\'s big idea, according to former colleagues, was to take a bottoms-up approach to the problem by working with local and state health departments, which could better react to the data. He also looked for federal incentives to spur hospitals to share data without requiring them to build anything new. As he frequently described it, he wanted to help create a \"catcher\\'s mitt\" of all sorts of relevant data that could flow up to the CDC.\\n\\nTaha Kass-Hout, cardiologist and data scientist. Source: AWS\\n\\nWithin a few years, more than 70% of hospitals agreed to share data with the system, which was called Biosense 2.0. That system is now called the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), and was one of the first government projects to be hosted on Amazon\\'s cloud computing service, AWS, where Kass-Hout now works. \"A lot of health systems weren\\'t reporting,\" recalled Aneesh Chopra, the first chief technology officer of the White House, appointed in 2009 by President Barack Obama. \"But that changed when we got this champion called Taha Kass-Hout, alongside a young whippersnapper over in New York City called Farzad Mostashari, who with a band of brothers and sisters set up a network on a local and state level and they got lots of hospitals to participate.\" NSSP still runs off of Amazon Web Services, and the company hired Kass-Hout in 2018 as its chief medical officer. An Amazon spokesperson did not make Kass-Hout available for an interview. Kass-Hout has spoken publicly over the years about the potential to use data from non-traditional sources for tracking disease. The Biosense 2.0 system tracked news reports, absenteeism, weather reports, and social media. It also relied heavily on the symptoms that patients reported themselves, and not just their doctors\\' interpretations or the test results. Kass-Hout co-authored research papers showing the value in asking patients whether they had a fever, versus checking it with a thermometer -- if they\\'d noticed a fever earlier in the day, they may simply have popped an aspirin, lowering their temperature before they arrived at the doctor\\'s office. \"In those days, we knew the next major pandemic would look like an atypical flu,\" said Arien Malec, who worked in the White House at the Department of Health and Human Services at the same time as Kass-Hout. \"Taha, when he was at the CDC, put in place a true bio-surveillance network that took all kinds of feeds and monitored them centrally. It was \\'big data\\' before it was cool.\" The idea of extending the surveillance beyond health data to other sources was gaining ground outside of the CDC as well.\\n\\nHarvard medical school professor John Brownstein John Brownstein\\n\\nIn the mid-2000s, John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children\\'s Hospital, started to reach out to Silicon Valley with some ideas about how to leverage data from Google search queries, social media feeds and step counts via some of the earliest wearable trackers. In 2008, Google agreed to supply estimates for influenza for 25 countries with public health departments through a project called Google Flu Trends. \"I got tired of relying solely on health data,\" he said. \"I saw that with Google and Twitter, I could get to global data immediately and in real-time, and I saw the potential to use it as part of a broader biosurveillance system.\" When the H1N1 swine flu pandemic came in 2009, the epidemiologists and data scientists advocating for syndromic surveillance had their moment in the sun. Public health officials leaned heavily on the Biosense program to help them assess the extent of the illness, learn where there were gaps in testing, and guide the experts at the federal level in making decisions about immunization recommendations, school and building closures, and other steps. The agency routinely shared updates with the public about the regions that were hardest hit by the virus. The data went far deeper than simply reporting the number of confirmed cases of the disease, because the CDC knew that the true numbers were difficult to gauge when there are lags in testing. \"At that point, national syndromic surveillance really took off,\" recalled Chopra, the former U.S. chief technology officer.\\n\\nA medical worker prepares a flu vaccine for a student in a middle school in Xian, China on November 9, 2009. China Photos | Getty Images\\n\\nGovernment disinterest and calls to the private sector\\n\\nAs of Friday, more than 1 million people have been infected and more than 57,000 have died from COVID-19. The pandemic has moved well beyond the containment phase, and there are reports of community-spread throughout the United States and in many other countries. It\\'s a perfect situation for syndromic surveillance. Instead of reacting to outbreaks like a whack-a-mole game, syndromic surveillance could help officials send resources where they\\'re needed most -- before hospitals in hot spots like New York and New Orleans get overwhelmed. As shelter-in-place orders are relaxed in the coming months, public health experts say it could be used to inform local officials about potential outbreaks so they could send people home even if the rest of the county or state is back to work. \"The beauty of syndromic surveillance is that it can be used when there are limited lab reports,\" said Isaac Bogoch, an associate professor of Infectious Diseases at the University of Toronto. \"And right now, there\\'s a shortage of lab tests in almost every country.\" \"It\\'s one of the best tools we have,\" added Hamilton, the epidemiologist running CSTE. \"It can also be helpful in tracking the severity of cases, and assess the proportion of patients that require more critical care and attention.\" But some of the key organizations and projects have lost funding in the past decade, as the memory of 9/11 and SARS grew dimmer. The International Society for Syndromic Surveillance shut its doors in June of 2019, six months before the coronavirus started spreading like wildfire in Wuhan, China. Its last executive director, Shandy Dearth, who has spent her career in infectious disease surveillance, said the society struggled because of cutbacks to the CDC. \"A lot of the money that sustained us came in after 9/11 with all the emergency preparedness funding, but it just kept dwindling every year,\" she said. \"Public health gets an influx of interest right after something bad has happened, but we don\\'t put enough emphasis on prevention.\"\\n\\nIdeas jotted down to tackle pandemics at the International Society for Syndromic Surveillance before it was disbanded in 2019. Farzad Mostashari\\n\\nThe Biosense system, now NSSP, still exists and continues to pull in information every day. But even now, only about 70% of hospitals share data, and many in the public health say it could use an upgrade. Some experts, frustrated with the lack of coordinated public support, are turning to the private sector ‚Äî and the tech industry in particular ‚Äî to help. A philanthropic group with ties to the tech industry called Resolve to Save Lives views symptomatic surveillance as a key piece to get Americans back to regular life. \"If you look at some of the first known cases of this, like the patient at UC Davis, it took up to a week for them to get tested,\" noted Cyrus Shahpar, a medical epidemiologist with Resolve to Save Lives and a former epidemic intelligence service officer with the CDC. \"So we need to learn from the early signals.\" The group, run by former CDC chief Tom Friedan, has raised more than $225 million from tech-connected organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\\n\\nHealthcare workers wheel the bodies of deceased people from the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, New York, U.S., April 2, 2020.

We asked members of CNBC\\'s technology team to give our readers a short glimpse into one activity they\\'re doing now with regularity that wouldn\\'t otherwise be on the daily agenda. There\\'s music, food, sports and good old-fashioned reality television. Maybe some of these will help you find new ways to pass the time.

My wife and I have been doing daily \"music class\" with both kids during quarantine. I play the piano and we all join in the sing-alongs. Here\\'s what I\\'ve learned: They don\\'t care that I play the piano. They enjoy singing. My piano accompaniment is irrelevant at best, an annoying distraction at worst. We have one more son on the way.

I made some pickled cucumbers and have now graduated to jalapenos. It takes about a day to be able to sample the finished product, but luckily I have nothing but time right now. The other way I\\'ve been keeping busy is playing the video game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Nintendo timed the release of this perfectly. It\\'s extremely wholesome and calming (great for when the world feels like it\\'s on fire).

The site offers scores of maps, ranging from World 2.0 (a much larger world map) to the western front of World War II. I\\'m mostly playing with old friends from high school, now scattered around the country in Seattle, New York, San Francisco and the Washington, D.C. area. We played in high school, and the site hasn\\'t been updated since. The software has a very 2007 feel and the message board is a throwback. On most games, you get 24 hours to make your move, so a game can last weeks. One game is now in its 50th round, although I\\'ve been eliminated.

To me, baking is obnoxiously precise and can require so much waiting. These days, for obvious reasons, I have a little more patience. For the uninitiated, no-knead bread making is an hours-long affair (days if you\\'re making your own starter), and requires a lot of coddling. There\\'s moving the dough around, folding it, wrapping it up in cloth, checking on it and a whole lot of waiting. My first attempts were a bit flat and not salty enough due to a misstep in flour choice.

However, with the virus continuing to spread, many may wonder how they can best protect themselves from getting sick if they do need to go shopping. Consumers should first evaluate their own risk level for catching the virus before deciding to visit a grocery store, according to Karen Hoffmann, a registered nurse and the immediate past president of The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. Those who are highly immunosuppresed, have cancer, are on certain medications or are over the age of 65, should consider other options such as buying online or having someone else shop for them, according to Hoffmann. Before visiting the store, shoppers should also have a solid plan of what they\\'re going to buy and prioritize what they they need. \"People should try to think in terms of buying at least two weeks\\' worth so they can minimize the number of trips that they\\'re actually taking to the grocery store,\" Hoffmann said.\\n\\nLeave the kids at home\\n\\nIf possible, children should not be taken on shopping trips and should remain at home. \"We don\\'t recommend bringing children because they will touch everything and increase the risk of exposure to them, and ultimately to their caregivers,\" Hoffmann said. In order to best protect themselves from COVID-19 while at the grocery store, shoppers should first understand how the virus spreads, according to Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University. \"It is transmitted by respiratory droplets and by contact,\" Racaniello said of the coronavirus. \"When you talk or cough or sneeze, you spray very small droplets out of your respiratory tract.\" He said that people can become infected when these droplets become lodged in the upper respiratory tract or when someone handles something contaminated with the virus and then proceeds to touch their mouth, nose or eyes. In order to avoid breathing in droplets, both Hoffmann and Racaniello advise shoppers to practice social distancing and maintain distances of six feet apart from other people. When engaging with others, shoppers can turn their heads and not directly face the other person, Hoffmann added. \"Simply diverting your attention from one another can make a difference,\" she said.\\n\\nWhat about masks and gloves?\\n\\nWhile there has been national debate over the usefulness of masks, Hoffmann said the benefit of wearing one varies based on its quality. \"You don\\'t want to be overly reliant on a mask that gets damp and may actually collect pathogens,\" she said.\\n\\nHoffmann said that it\\'s difficult for homemade masks to replicate the filtering ability of those worn by health care workers, but they may be useful when worn by people who are infectious. \"Because we do have so much asymptomatic spread, people wearing a mask, who may be infected or mildly infected ‚Äî it could contain their droplets,\" Hoffmann said. She added that masks should always be put on and taken off with clean hands in order to prevent cross-contamination. As for gloves, they can do more harm than good, according to Hoffmann. \"You can think about wearing gloves, but unless you\\'re really experienced with putting gloves on and off, you may actually contaminate your hands more and therefore get a false sense of security,\" Hoffmann said. During a grocery trip, shoppers should think about what they touch in the store. Hoffman advised wiping down the handle of a shopping cart before holding it. Racaniello said one of the riskiest moments during a shopping excursion is paying at the cash register. \"You go to check-out, you give your credit card, put it in a slot, you punch the numbers, you sign that little machine ‚Äî that in particular, a lot of people have touched,\" he said. Racaniello said shoppers should avoid touching their faces after using a credit card machine and even use a hand sanitizer immediately after.\\n\\nTake off your shoes when you get home\\n\\nAfter arriving home from a trip to the grocery store, the first thing Racaniello does is remove his shoes. He said that after lingering in the air, droplets containing the virus fall to the ground, where they can be picked up by feet. \"If you have kids, they may crawl on the floor and so forth, so you don\\'t want to track those into your house,\" Racaniello said of the viral particles. The next step is to engage in extensive hand-washing. \"The sooner you can get to the sink and wash your hands with soap and water, the better,\" Racaniello said. He also recommends wiping down groceries with an alcohol-based spray once they\\'re brought inside as the virus typically lives for 24 hours on plastic and cardboard surfaces.\\n\\nWashing fruits and vegetables\\n\\nHoffman fills her sink with water and adds a small cup of vinegar in order to wash her fruits and vegetables after purchasing them. She did this even before the pandemic, as it helps kill fungus and keeps produce from deteriorating. \"Fruits and vegetables, I always clean anyways just because they come from so many different places around the world, and they\\'re handled by so many people,\" Hoffmann said. While some of these practices may seem extreme, Racaniello said, people have to be prepared to change their behavior. \"You have to look at life in a different way than you did before, at least for the time being,\" he said.\\n\\nSteps stores are taking', 'author': ['Hannah Miller']}, {'link': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/04/trump-says-navy-captain-letter-asking-for-help-on-coronavirus-stricken-ship-was-terrible.html', 'published': '2020-04-05T15:58:37', 'title': \"Trump says Navy captain letter asking for help on coronavirus-stricken ship 'was terrible'\", 'text': 'Captain Brett Crozier addresses the crew for the first time as commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt during a change of command ceremony on the ship\\'s flight deck in San Diego, California, U.S. November 1, 2019.\\n\\nA since-fired Navy captain\\'s plea for help with a coronavirus outbreak on his vessel \"was terrible,\" President Donald Trump said Saturday.\\n\\nThe officer, Capt.

With everyone in duress, landlords and creditors with the ability to pull the trigger that could put a retailer into bankruptcy have become gun shy.\\n\\n\"Everyone has a gun to their head,\" said one banker requesting anonymity. \"It\\'s mutually assured destruction.\"\\n\\nIn March, there were four retail bankruptcies, according to Debtwire parent Acuris. That\\'s more than the two retail bankruptcies that occurred in the same month last year, but it doesn\\'t reflect the pain that has crippled the industry which has been forced to shutter its stores.\\n\\nState governments are telling Americans to avoid crowds and ordering nonessential businesses shut. With nowhere to go, Americans have little reason to shop the inventory that retailers have already stocked. Macy\\'s market capitalization has dropped from about $6 billion in mid-February to $1.5 billion. Fast-fashion retailer H&M has said it is weighing temporarily laying off tens of thousands of workers worldwide. There could be a record-setting 15,000 store closures this year, according to Coresight Research.\\n\\nBut unlike prior crises that swept other industries, the issue isn\\'t simply that the retail business is broken ‚Äî the problem is that there\\'s deep uncertainty about when the pandemic will end and what the world will look like after the crisis is over. That\\'s not a problem bankruptcies can solve, and it\\'s not a problem many lenders want to take on themselves.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Delta, United Airlines and U.S. Airlines filed for bankruptcy in the wake of Sept. 11, they were able to shed onerous debt, restructure labor contracts and reduce capacity. They did, in fact, emerge stronger companies than they were prior to bankruptcy.\\n\\nRetailers, though, are facing a cash-flow problem, not just a structural challenge. They\\'re not bringing in money because they can\\'t operate. Any retailer weighing filing for bankruptcy has no idea when stores may reopen again, and what the world will look like when they do.\\n\\n\"Filing for bankruptcy doesn\\'t create a sudden cure for the virus, it doesn\\'t create a cure to open stores ‚Äî so why incur the expenses of Chapter 11 when you\\'re not going be able to do anything while business is closed?\" said Michael Sirota, co-chair of the bankruptcy and corporate restructuring department at Cole Schotz\\n\\nLandlords and creditors, which are sometimes one in the same, are aware of that reality.\\n\\nLuxury retailer Barney\\'s filed for bankruptcy last year after its landlord raised the rent that wiped away its earnings. But Barney\\'s landlord likely believed it had other alternatives to replace the retailer in its prime real estate, like Manhattan\\'s Madison Avenue. Now, with virtually every retailer\\'s stores shuttered, there is no easy replacement to stand in on a property.\\n\\nInstead, landlords are in their own pain and facing their own uncertainty. The nation\\'s largest mall owner, Simon Property Group, has temporarily closed all its more than 200 malls and outlet centers. When and how many malls it reopens will significantly impact the economics of its business.\\n\\n\"There is disruption in the real estate market and a lot of unknown in retail: is the mall going to be there or not? Will I have cash or not?\" said Christa Hart, senior managing director at FTI Consulting.\\n\\nDebt-holders that have the ability to help force a company into bankruptcy if it is late on interest payments or violates its covenants are aware of this reality, say bankruptcy bankers and lawyers. It makes it difficult for them to negotiate the terms of emerging from bankruptcy, because there is no clear view of what retail looks like in one month or three months. There is limited upside forcing a retailer to liquidate because it is nearly impossible to hold a liquidation sale with retailers forced close.\\n\\nModell\\'s recently had to pause its liquidation efforts, because its liquidation sales ran right up against government guidance to stay home. The sports retailer had filed for bankruptcy on March 11 and began its closing sales March 13. The same day, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic and the U.S. economy began to shut down.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not as if we were using the space or premises and selling inventory and not paying them,\" said Sirota who advised Modell\\'s on the bankruptcy \"We were deprived of that access.\"\\n\\nThe landlords agreed in that case to delay rent payments.\\n\\nWith liquidation sales seemingly untenable in the short term, there is also little desire to finance bankruptcies. Financing bankers who spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity said while it may be possible to get financing for bankruptcy from existing lenders, the bar has been raised significantly for new lenders. That stands in contrast to bankruptcies like Toys R Us and even Sears, when banks lined up to offer assistance.\\n\\nThat\\'s not to say there won\\'t be retail bankruptcies, particularly for companies with impatient investors or with already significantly broken businesses. Once the cloud of uncertainty lifts, there will likely be many more.\\n\\nBut until then, though, for most retailers, the only option is to cut costs. Macy\\'s and Kohl\\'s have furloughed most of their employees. Retailers are slashing investment, putting projects on hold, and culling through other expenses like outside consultants. They\\'re also delaying their payments to the brands that have already shipped product to help conserve their cash, say sources familiar with the situation.\\n\\nSome have thought about tapping the pool of money laid out for business in the $2 trillion CARE act, lobbyists have told CNBC, but it remains unclear how quickly they can get those funds. The government has implied it will attach tough strings to any loans it offers to large businesses, like requirements around headcount that industries with high-fixed costs ‚àí like retail ‚àíare wary to commit to.\\n\\nSome retail companies are also pushing for relief in a potential fourth package, lobbyists said.\\n\\nThe separation of winners and losers that was already happening in retail will continue, but at an expedited pace. Department stores will suffer, weighed down by large real estate footprints that make little sense to today\\'s shoppers. Those that have been strapped with debt and unable to invest in their business will fall further behind. Many apparel brands will struggle to compete. And Walmart will be a survivor.\\n\\n\"In the summer, it will be where we thought the industry would be in five years,\" said FTI\\'s Hart.\\n\\nCNBC\\'s Lauren Thomas contributed to this report.', 'author': ['Lauren Hirsch']}, {'link': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-pharmacies-struggle-to-meet-demand-amid-supply-shortages.html', 'published': '2020-04-04T18:05:21', 'title': \"'There's a shortage of everything': Pharmacies in New York City struggle to keep key medications stocked amid coronavirus outbreak\", 'text': 'Emanuel Simhayev, owner and pharmacist at Get Well Rx in Astoria, Queens, consults with a customer purchasing face masks.

Simhayev, 33, and his technician Evelyn Quirindongo, 53, are now scrambling to meet the surging demand for medication and other essentials at Get Well Rx Pharmacy in Astoria, Queens. As tens of thousands of people test positive in New York City and many more show symptoms and are presumed to have the virus, communities are turning to their neighborhood pharmacies for prescription and over-the-counter medicines to alleviate their symptoms. The unprecedented demand created by the global pandemic is creating shortages for even basic over-the-counter drugs like Tylenol, as supply chains strain from the manufacturers that produce the medications to the wholesalers that deliver them to pharmacies, making it extraordinarily difficult to keep shelves fully stocked for key items in hot zones like New York. \"I never thought a pharmacy in the 21st century can run out of essentials, the most basic medications,\" Simhayev said. \"When you face this hardship you cannot really help much.

Pulse oximeters, used to monitor blood-oxygen levels, were unavailable until May 31. Ventolin inhalers, which can ease shortness of breath, were only available two units at a time. The two most talked about drugs, which have inspired some hope as possible treatments for the virus, are also in short supply. A study in France concluded that hydroxychloroquine, usually used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases, was particularly effective in fighting the virus when used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, though those results have been disputed. New York state is now conducting its own clinical trials. Effective or not in the fight against COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine is on backorder, and azithromycin, often sold under the brand name Zithromax Z-pak, is in very limited supply and almost unavailable, according to Liristis\\' records. S Bros Pharmacy in Brooklyn\\'s Williamsburg neighborhood filled its inventory with hydroxychloroquine and Z-paks when word spread the drugs were a possible treatment.

Staff was excited to receive a few cans of Lysol spray so they can disinfect the store more often than once a night. \"There\\'s a shortage of everything ‚Äî it\\'s never enough,\" said Evangeline Frezoulis, 37, the pharmacy manager at S Bros. \"The wholesalers are not able to supply as many pharmacies as needed.\" When Broadway Chemists doesn\\'t have an item in stock, Liristis tells customers to check with chain pharmacies, even though that hurts business for smaller, family-owned stores. \"You\\'re just trying to help the patient get what they need,\" Liristis said. \"It doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s here or somewhere else ‚Äî we\\'re just trying to work together.\" Pharmacies are improvising when they can.

In response, AmerisourceBergen is limiting how much pharmacies receive of certain drugs to ensure they get at least some product, a policy the company calls \"fair allocation.\" Cardinal Health, another major wholesaler, said it\\'s managing the distribution of more than 100,000 products considered critical inventory which are in unprecedented demand since the pandemic started to spread. \"We are experiencing backorders and declining inventory levels at rates never experienced before,\" the company said, in a website statement, warning that customers may only receive partial deliveries while other products are out of stock altogether.\\n\\n\\'An epidemic you never even imagined\\'\\n\\nAs the virus spreads, pharmacies are doing what they can to protect employees from exposure and enforce social distancing.

So, he keeps his door open to accommodate the line and create space so the store doesn\\'t become overcrowded.\\n\\nWith horrible situations like 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina and Sandy, you knew there was an end at some point ‚Äî there was finality to it.

Yitzy Engelberg Pharmacist and owner, Best Five Star Pharmacy\\n\\nQueens has been particularly hard hit by the virus with 34% of the more than 52,000 confirmed infections in the city as of Friday. In Simhayev\\'s area of Astoria, at least 144 people have tested positive, according to data released by the New York City Department of Health on Wednesday. The number of infections is likely higher as testing remains limited. Simhayev said a woman came to his pharmacy panicking earlier in the week and cut to the front of the line asking for medication to treat her husband\\'s cough and shortness of breath. Simhayev sent them to the doctor next door and an ambulance was ultimately called for the man, who is in his 40s and was presumed positive. \"You have things like this happening, and you have a line of people waiting,\" Simhayev said. \"When you work in times like this, it\\'s an epidemic that you never even imagined was possible.\" Some pharmacies are no longer open to foot traffic. Broadway Chemists shifted to delivery only to prevent the small store from overcrowding and keep employees safe from exposure. The pharmacy\\'s neighborhood has at least 204 confirmed cases of the virus, according to city data. \"Small stores can\\'t afford to get infected,\" Liristis said. \"If one person gets infected, we\\'d have to shut our doors and not be able to accommodate the community.\"', 'author': ['Spencer Kimball']}, {'link': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-walmart-amazon-turn-to-thermometers-as-detection-tool.html', 'published': '2020-04-04T13:50:26', 'title': 'As coronavirus cases grow, some of the largest US employers including Walmart and Amazon turn to thermometers as detection tool', 'text': 'Customer Deanna Arthur of Alhambra has her temperature taken by Sophia Huang, a supervisor at Sichuan Impression restaurant in Alhambra.

They will send employees home if they have a temperature of 100.0 degrees or higher. Those employees will not be able to return to work until they\\'re fever-free for at least three days. Bartlett said the company is encouraging employees to check their temperatures at home until screenings start at their facility. Along with taking temperatures, the company will do a basic health screening of employees, such as asking about travel, exposure or other symptoms, such as coughing or feeling achy. At Amazon, temperature checks will be rolled out to all U.S. and European facilities, including warehouses and Whole Foods grocery stores, by early next week. The company said it\\'s already started them at some U.S. sites. Employees who have a temperature that\\'s higher than 100.4 degrees will be sent home and asked to stay home until they\\'re fever free for three days.\\n\\nB.J.\\'s Wholesale Club said that over the coming weeks, it will begin checking temperatures of all employees at its 218 stores when they report to work. All employees will enter through a designated entrance where the company will check their temperatures. The company said in a news release that it will also start providing masks and gloves for employees who want to wear them. At Home Depot, the approach is different. Employees are receiving a company-provided thermometer to hold up to their forehead. If they have a fever ‚Äî particularly of 100.4 or higher, the CDC\\'s cutoff ‚Äî they\\'re asked to stay home, company spokeswoman Sara Gorman said. Starbucks is sending thermometers to all company-operated stores for employees who would like to \"self-monitor their temperature as added reassurance before they start their shift,\" Rossann Williams, the chain\\'s executive vice president of the U.S. company-operated business and Canada, wrote in a letter to employees Wednesday. She said the temperature checks are voluntary. All of the retailers have encouraged employees who don\\'t feel well to stay home, too, by adding or expanding their paid time off policies. Walmart and Amazon also said this week that they will provide masks for employees, who can choose whether to wear them.\\n\\n\\'False security\\' or \\'Better than nothing\\'?\\n\\nMedical professionals have warned about the limits of temperature checks ‚Äî particularly since the coronavirus can silently spread. The director of the CDC, Dr. Robert Redfield, said in a National Public Radio interview broadcast on Tuesday that as many as 25% of people infected with COVID-19 may not show any symptoms. Some studies have indicated that percentage could be even higher. Dr. Ghazala Sharieff, chief medical officer at San Diego-based Scripps Health, said some have urged her hospital system to screen doctors, nurses and other employees with temperature checks. She said she\\'s opposed to the tool because it can be inaccurate from a distance and create \"false security.\" \"Any medical person will tell you that\\'s actually not a great screening,\" she said. \"If you just pop some Advil or Tylenol, you can get through the screen because you want to come to work.\" Instead, she recommends employers and employees look out for one another and watch for possible signs and symptoms. \"You see somebody coughing, you ought to tell somebody and go home,\" she said. \"More of that kind of relationship is more important.\" Dr. David Hindin, a general surgeon and an academic fellow at Stanford University who studies health technology innovation, acknowledged the temperature screenings can be faulty. Some patients, for example, don\\'t spike a fever right away ‚Äî or never do. Still, he said \"it\\'s better than nothing\" for essential workers who must continue to commute and interact with others. He recommended employers couple temperature checks with screening for other symptoms, such as asking employees if they have a cough or fatigue. He said he\\'s opposed to using temperature checks to justify the reopening of nonessential businesses, such as movie theaters or restaurants. \"If they\\'re using that as a decision point to open up earlier, then I don\\'t think it holds as much water,\" he said.\\n\\nScreening customers', 'author': ['Melissa Repko']}, {'link': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/coronavirus-hurts-silicon-valley-caterers-and-event-businesses.html', 'published': '2020-04-04T18:41:04', 'title': 'Silicon Valley businesses who made their living from tech industry events are suddenly staring at blank calendars and layoffs', 'text': 'Daniel Chan is among a number of small-business owners who rely on the tech industry\\'s parties and conferences and are now staring at blank calendars with no idea of when they will be able to return to their livelihoods.

The venue is in talks with clients to book events for late in the fourth quarter, but also finds itself looking at the precise working of contracts more carefully than ever before. Specifically, clients are zeroing in on what exactly constitutes a \"force majeure\" or act of God, Kirk said. Whereas before a contract might just account for a natural disaster, now the contracts include language for \"global pandemic\" or anything in which the government could put restrictions on travel, she said.\\n\\nThe Midway is among a number of San Francisco Bay Area small business that rely on the tech industry\\'s parties and conferences and are now staring at blank calendars with no idea of when they will be able to return to their livelihoods.

I\\'ve watched their tremendous expansion driven by commercial globalization, and their strategic initiatives toward shedding costly real estate and fleets of the largest passenger planes, such as 747\\'s.

It helps to examine some of the calculated risks at airlines, hotels and casinos that have both contributed to the growth in operating margins but also put them at greater risk should the economy shift down dramatically.\\n\\nIn the past ten years, as interest rates have fallen to record low levels, businesses have been incentivized to use cheap money to expand.\\n\\nAs might be expected, long-term, debt-to-equity for these sectors has risen. Hilton has $9 billion of long-term debt and no equity; Marriott, after its $13 billion acquisition of Starwood, has $10.8 billion in long-term debt against $0.7 billion of equity; and Wynn Resorts\\' comparable numbers at $10.2 billion of debt and $1.7 billion of equity. Several airline bankruptcies in the Great Recession wiped out airline debt, so their balance sheets appear cleaner than their growth would suggest.\\n\\nWhether corporations own, lease, or franchise their planes, hotels and casinos, the major players have expanded their scope significantly. Airline available seat miles, for example, soared, figuratively, up 140% since 2011, while revenue per average seat mile for the domestic carriers has remained within a tight range.\\n\\nTo cover their higher annual debt or lease payments, the travel and lodging industries have needed to fill more seats and rooms. Sure enough, load factor for the airline industry has risen from the mid-70% range in the early 2000\\'s to 85% recently while occupancy for US hotels has climbed from around 59% at the start of the millennium to 66% last year.\\n\\nWhen the state of Massachusetts decided to legalize casinos, Wynn jumped at the chance. It proposed an extravagant casino/hotel in a densely populated neighborhood of a town adjacent to Boston, difficult to reach and without ample parking. Their early outlook, suggesting close to $220 million in first full year operating profits, will prove wildly optimistic, even in a normal environment.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of Covid-19, closing all leisure facilities across the country, Wynn has appealed to the state of Massachusetts and federal government for tax relief and bailout assistance, citing its hefty 5,000-person workforce. As Wynn\\'s management might have badly miscalculated the payoff for the project, should its share of a bailout be judged primarily on the size of its staff? Likewise, should some other criteria be used for Hilton, whose share repurchase followed its spin-out, with abundant debt, from Blackstone, or American Airlines after its jumbo-jet-sized share purchase?\\n\\nAt first glance, I thought there should be some penalty right now for imprudent risk-taking prior to this crisis, based on measures of debt, liquidity, stock repurchases, etc. But I\\'ve since changed my mind.\\n\\nHopefully, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Those workers need to receive income from Wynn, Delta Air Lines, and Marriott by way of the bailout, or they will get it another way, straight from the government. Call it a transfer payment, a shifted wage responsibility, or unemployment insurance, but we need to do it and it is easier to have them stay within the company.\\n\\nIn addition, the federal government should learn from Treasury\\'s Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008, which successfully ventilated the entire financial system that was imploding under the weight of some very risky behavior. TARP handed out $442 billion, and, basically, broke even, despite the list of beneficiaries that a Who\\'s Who of banking giants.\\n\\nThe government should attach some financial and operating strings to this bailout so taxpayers ultimately profit in the rebuild, particularly with the large corporations in the many industries left vulnerable when people can\\'t go anyway.\\n\\nWhen they reopen the Encore in Las Vegas, I\\'ll be there.\\n\\nKaren Firestone is chairman, CEO, and co-founder of Aureus Asset Management, an investment firm dedicated to providing contemporary asset management to families, individuals and institutions.', 'author': ['Karen Firestone']}, {'link': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/el-erian-stocks-could-still-go-back-down-to-new-coronavirus-lows.html', 'published': '2020-04-03T14:32:01', 'title': 'Mohamed El-Erian: The stock market could still go back down to new coronavirus lows', 'text': 'The stock market could still touch new lows as uncertainty around the coronavirus pandemic persists, Mohamed El-Erian said Friday.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think we\\'re forming a bottom yet.

Jason Lee | Reuters\\n\\nHere we go again. It sounds outrageous: The chief operating officer of Luckin Coffee, the largest domestic coffee chain in the China, was accused by his own company of fabricating much of its reported sales in 2019. Luckin also said that certain costs and expenses were substantially inflated and advised that investors shouldn\\'t rely on previous financial statements for the nine months ended Sept. 30. The company has only been public since May. To add insult to injury, Luckin sold 4.8 million shares of stock in a secondary stock offering in January at $42 a share, raising over $380 million in new capital. The stock, which trades on Nasdaq, dropped more than 75% on Thursday. You can already smell the lawsuits.\\n\\n\\'A wake-up call for U.S. policymakers\\'\\n\\nMuddy Waters Research published a critical report on the company in January describing it as fraud and a \"fundamentally broken business.\" It was quick to take a victory lap and make an even broader claim. \"This is again a wake-up call for U.S. policymakers, regulators, and investors about the extreme fraud risk China-based companies pose to our markets,\" founder Carson Block said in a statement to CNBC. While this is a particularly egregious example, this has happened many times with Chinese companies, including those that have listed in the U.S. More than a decade ago, hundreds of Chinese companies went public in the U.S. via reverse mergers, merging into public but mostly dormant U.S. companies. Many turned out to be frauds ‚Äî so many that a movie, \"The China Hustle,\" was made about the whole wild affair.\\n\\nThe weak point in oversight: Auditing\\n\\nFast forward to today, and one particularly weak point stands out: auditing procedures. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton and William Duhnke III, chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, have often noted that U.S. regulators are prevented from inspecting audit work and practices of audit firms in China. They have called for more cooperation from China, to no avail. All foreign companies that list on U.S. exchanges must have their financial statements audited by an independent firm. Multinational companies are generally audited by firms in their own country. This is true regardless of whether the firm listing in the U.S. is based in China, Russia, Turkey, France or anywhere else. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 established the PCAOB. It required that every domestic and foreign accounting firm that issues audit reports for companies that report to the SEC register with the board. The board is required to periodically inspect registered firm audits of U.S. public companies, including those done by foreign firms, and this has caused significant friction with foreign accounting firms and their regulators. Over time, the PCAOB negotiated agreements with foreign counterparts that allowed them to perform audit inspections. Clayton and Duhnke issued a joint statement in December 2018 noting that the board had entered into cooperative agreements with 23 foreign regulators that allow them to conduct either joint inspections or share inspection findings with regulators in those jurisdictions. China, however, is one of the few countries that has not been cooperating with the board. Clayton and Duhnke reiterated their frustration in a Feb. 19 statement, where they noted that the board \"continues to be prevented from inspecting the audit work and practices of PCAOB-registered audit firms in China on a comparable basis to other non-U.S. jurisdictions.\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has also been vocal about the reluctance of China\\'s regulatory authority to cooperate with the United States. In June, Rubio and several other senators introduced a bill to delist firms that are out of compliance with U.S. regulators for a period of three years, with a particular emphasis on China. In an email to CNBC, Rubio had this to say about the Luckin misconduct: \"It\\'s outrageous that we continue to allow the Chinese government to shield U.S.-listed Chinese companies from complying with the SEC\\'s disclosure and audit regulations. While some have used recent events to call for increasing investments in China-based securities, this unfortunate but unsurprising incident highlights the tremendous risk posed by such investments. This should be a major wake-up call for policymakers and regulators: if Chinese companies want to be listed on U.S. exchanges, they must comply with American laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability.\"\\n\\nShould Luckin continue to trade on a U.S. exchange?', 'author': ['Bob Pisani']}, {'link': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/jim-chanos-says-beware-the-virus-stocks-like-peloton-zoom-benefiting-temporarily-from-lockdowns.html', 'published': '2020-04-02T19:16:44', 'title': \"Jim Chanos says beware the 'virus stocks' like Peloton, Zoom benefiting temporarily from lockdowns\", 'text': 'Short seller Jim Chanos warned investors about piling into \"virus stocks\" boosted by the coronavirus lockdown temporarily.\\n\\n\"One area I would warn people about for example is the virus stocks,\" Chanos said on Thursday on CNBC\\'s Halftime Report.

Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nMacy\\'s is being dropped from the S&P 500, and in a sign of how far the fortunes of retail have fallen, it is being banished all the way down to the small-cap S&P 600, skipping the mid-cap S&P 400. It will likely not be the last company to suffer such humiliation amid coronavirus-related shutdowns. Macy\\'s will be dropped from the S&P 500 on Friday to be replaced by Carrier Global, which is being spun out of United Technologies after United merges with Raytheon. S&P\\'s decision to kick Macy\\'s out of the big-cap index is certainly understandable. Macy\\'s has dropped from a market capitalization of roughly $6 billion in mid-February to $1.5 billion today. \"Macy\\'s has a market capitalization more representative of the small-cap market space,\" S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the S&P 500, said in a terse statement. The problem is, Macy\\'s has plenty of company. Kohl\\'s, Nordstrom, Gap and Hanesbrands all have market caps in the $2 billion range. So do plenty of energy companies, such as Apache, Devon, and Marathon Oil.\\n\\nCould there be a purge of retailers and energy companies from the big-cap rankings?\\n\\nHoward Silverblatt, senior index analyst for Standard and Poor\\'s S&P Dow Jones Indices, sees a purge as possible. \"That would essentially be saying that retailers, with a few exceptions like Walmart, are no longer big-cap companies,\" he said.\\n\\nWho decides what goes in and out of the S&P 500?\\n\\nThe components of the S&P 500 are selected by an index committee, which meets monthly. Unlike the Russell 2000, which is strictly rules-based, the S&P indexes and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are not based on strict guidelines. \"Constituent selection is at the discretion of the Index Committee and is based on the eligibility criteria,\" S&P says. The criteria for inclusion include domicile (U.S. companies), liquidity (dollar-value traded), and financial viability. Market capitalization guidelines are also a factor, and here S&P is very explicit on how big a company needs to be to be included in one of the three major indexes: Market capitalization eligibility: S&P 500: $8.2 billion or more\\n\\nMidcap 400: $2.4 billion to $8.2 billion\\n\\nSmall cap 600: $600 million to $2.4 billion. Source: S&P Indices\\n\\nSome groups are likely to see diminished representation in the S&P 500\\n\\nJudged solely by market capitalization, many companies in the S&P 500 appear in danger of being kicked out. About 100 companies in the index have market caps at or below $8.2 billion and so are technically mid caps; 14 are already in small-cap territory. But that does not necessarily mean they\\'ll be kicked out immediately. \"Putting in is one criteria, but taking out is a different issue,\" Silverblatt said. \"You can fall way down in market value but it won\\'t necessarily get thrown out just because of that. More typical is that it no longer represents the group it is in, or the group as a whole just isn\\'t a big-cap group anymore.\" He said there\\'s ample precedent, pointing to publishers, whose share prices collapsed a decade ago. The New York Times, for example, was taken out of the S&P 500 and put into the Midcap 400 in December 2010. \"Publishers were no longer a big-cap group,\" Silverblatt said. Gannett and Washington Post were both in the S&P 500 and were subsequently removed. Another point: The criteria for what constitutes small-, mid- and big-caps can and do change. The most recent changes were effective on Feb. 20, 2019, but it is quite possible S&P could change again. Another issue is what to replace them with? Silverblatt noted that the S&P 500 still needs to reflect what the market cap of the overall big-cap market is. \"What other areas do you need representation in?\" he asked. \"Where am I underweighted? Do you need to add health care, for example?\"\\n\\nWe\\'re all indexers: Why it matters what groups go in and out of the S&P 500', 'author': ['Bob Pisani']}, {'link': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/01/investors-should-expect-a-confusing-earnings-season-ahead-with-delays-and-withdrawn-forecasts.html', 'published': '2020-04-01T18:50:13', 'title': 'Investors should expect a confusing earnings season ahead with delays and withdrawn forecasts', 'text': 'Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 20, 2020.\\n\\nHeading into earnings season, investors should expect delayed reports, withdrawn forecasts and confusing results from U.S. businesses grappling with the coronavirus shutdown.\\n\\nThere is a general consensus that company earnings are going to be ugly, with analysts expecting S&P 500 earnings growth to decline 5.2% in the first quarter, according to FactSet.

He added that almost every company apart from Chevron is not ready for an environment where oil prices are that low. \"You do not want a big raft of bankruptcies,\" he warned. Oil prices moved lower Wednesday as Saudi Arabia increased production to more than 12 million bpd, flooding the market during a time of unprecedented demand loss. The Saudi move, reported by Reuters, comes after talks between OPEC and its allies broke down in early March.

He is now chief gold strategist at State Street Global Advisors. This interview has been edited.\\n\\nGold is a commodity that is physically moved all over the world. How is the coronavirus impacting gold supply?\\n\\nWe are seeing an impact on the supply side. Three of the biggest refineries in the world are in Switzerland on the border with Italy. The local authorities have closed them down, we don\\'t know for how long. Some of the gold mining companies are offering lower guidance on production as well. So there is some impact on the supply side, and if supply is constrained, and demand is maintained, then you are liable to get higher prices.\\n\\nSince gold has to be physically moved, is there any problem transporting gold with airlines shutting down?\\n\\nI am not aware of any problems yet, but that could be an issue in the future.\\n\\nHow about gold demand? India and China are by far the two largest consumers of gold, right?\\n\\nYes they are. I do not yet have the data, but India is in lockdown so I fully expect jewelry demand to decline there. China is just coming out, so I would also expect demand to be lower there. Jewelry demand should also drop in the U.S. as well.\\n\\nGiven the lower expected demand, what do you think will happen with gold prices in the next few months?\\n\\nI am expecting gold to continue to make strides. Gold jewelry demand may drop, but I am expecting a large increase in investment. This is what happened in 2008: Jewelry demand dropped but gold investment increased. If you look at flows into GLD, we saw significant inflows ‚Äî just shy of $1 billion in the last week. We have had $3.8 billion in inflows year to date. Coronavirus is going to continue to be a concern. Brexit is still an issue. There are problems in the Korean peninsula. Investors have shifted from, \"Is there going to be a bear market\" to \"How long will the bear market last?\" All of this is positive for gold.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve is again expanding its quantitative easing program. Does this have any impact on gold pricing?\\n\\nIt likely will. When the Fed began its QE program in 2008, the Fed balance sheet went up. Gold went up 8% a year on average during that period from December 2008 to October 2014.\\n\\nIs that cause and effect or is it just coincidental?\\n\\nThe Fed was trying to stimulate activity, and gold investors saw this as a reason to up their allocations. It troubles people when the Fed intervenes in the markets the way they did.\\n\\nIn the first few weeks of March, gold dropped about 15% along with the stock market. What was going on there?\\n\\nGold did what it was supposed to do in this sort of environment. It came to the aid of investors when other investments were going south. In order to meet margin calls, gold was there to be sold, and it was indeed sold. This happened in 2009 and in 2002.\\n\\nAnd yet, gold bounced back again in the second half of March and recovered a good part of its losses.\\n\\nYes. Gold was sold, and then having done its job investors tend to buy it back again, so gold tends to recover.\\n\\nDo you have any concerns that recovery may not last?\\n\\nMy only concern about the outlook is a lot of commentators are calling for another dip in the stock market, and that could lead to another decline in the price of gold, which I don\\'t expect to be sustained.\\n\\nWhat part of an investment portfolio should gold be?\\n\\nOur research indicates anywhere from 2% to 10%, depending on your risk tolerance and liquidity needs.\\n\\nGold people always have an answer about why now is the right time to buy gold. Gold used to be a hedge against inflation, then it was a safe haven. It seems to be just about anything anyone wants it to be.\\n\\nWe all tend to focus on one thing, but there is a lot more to the equation. Some think gold is just an inflation hedge. In my view, gold is a hedge against the unexpected, whether it is a hedge against macroeconomics, or geopolitical like wars or pestilence. It has always been protection against the unexpected, whatever that might be. Gold tends to perform whenever anything unexpected happens.', 'author': ['Bob Pisani']}, {'link': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/31/large-investors-still-say-they-arent-ready-to-sell-as-coronavirus-crisis-continues.html', 'published': '2020-03-31T17:43:25', 'title': \"Large investors still say they aren't ready to sell as coronavirus crisis continues\", 'text': 'Investors grew increasingly concerned about the U.S. economy and the stock market as March wore on, but they also said they aren\\'t ready to abandon their stocks, according to several surveys.\\n\\nThe vast majority of the institutional clients surveyed by Citi expect an economic downturn and earnings estimates to be cut further in 2020, but they are more bullish on equities.

Many major investors, including billionaire Leon Cooperman earlier this month, are calling on the SEC to reinstate the uptick rule, which was implemented 1938 but was eliminated in 2007 as electronic trading began to take over Wall Street. Essentially, the old uptick rule only allowed investors to short a stock or a security on an uptick, which is defined by a price increase relative to its previous trade.\\n\\n\"We did put in place, and not a lot of people know this, an alternative uptick rule [in 2010.] And it\\'s a rule that I believe more closely matches the electronic trading environment of today,\" Clayton said. The SEC chairman said the current rule kicks in when a \"stock drops 10% from the previous day\\'s close for two days,\" preventing short selling the bid. He offered a hypothetical situation to explain further, \"If a bid/offer spread is $49 to $50, you can\\'t sell short on $49.\" \"We need market integrity,\" Clayton said. \"But we believe we\\'re taking care of it with this alternative uptick rule.\" Traders on the flip side of Cooperman\\'s argument would contend that getting rid of the uptick and other archaic rules have allowed electronic trading to flourish, bringing liquidity to the market and lower trading costs for investors.

Conventional Wall Street wisdom is that bear markets, or 20% declines from 52-week highs, die on bad news, and Thursday featured some of the worst the U.S. economy has ever seen. Nearly 3.3 million Americans filed initial jobless claims for the week ended March 21, marking the worst week ever, by far. The second-worst number came during the 1982 recession, and the report released Thursday more than quadrupled that total. Yet the market rose, violently so, at one point hitting 20% off the recent lows, which would define a bull market. That came just days after the longest bull market in history took the quickest fall into bear territory ever. The thinking about bear markets dying on bad news is that the market is always looking ahead, and when it fully prices in all of the awful stuff out there, the selling will stop even if current conditions look bleak. There wasn\\'t much sense to be made of the move Thursday, but it did spark talk that the worst of the market damage from the coronavirus crisis could be over. \"The markets and the economy don\\'t run in parallel. The market\\'s running way ahead of the economy,\" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. \"The markets don\\'t care about what\\'s happening today, the market cares about what\\'s happening six months from now.\" If that\\'s true, then it makes some sense that the market, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is rallying after falling some 37% from its historic peak set in February.\\n\\n\\'Indiscriminate selling\\' is over\\n\\nEconomists are expecting a steep fall for the economy in the second quarter that could exceed a 20% GDP decline, with some 10 million people out of work and an unemployment rate higher than anything the U.S. has ever seen. The jobless claims data offered the first test of whether investors would be willing to look through the bad readings and continue buying. There was some speculation that one of the reasons for the rally Thursday was that the number, while much higher than the 1.5 million consensus, wasn\\'t as bad as some forecasts of up to 4 million.\\n\\nFor a bottom to start forming \"we\\'ll need to see investors using that term, that it\\'s less bad,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"That\\'s typically what you wait for to begin to invest in earnest instead of just trading.\" Krosby said that market action before the claims report had been encouraging as Wall Street saw massive rallies Tuesday and Wednesday as well. \"The indiscriminate selling that you saw in order to raise money has eased, and that also matters,\" she said.\\n\\nA bottom, but maybe not the bottom\\n\\nWhile the data is likely to continue to be bad for a couple of months, a pronounced recovery is expected to follow. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told NBC\\'s \"TODAY\" show Thursday that he sees a \"good rebound\" in subsequent quarters and pledged the central bank will to whatever it can to ensure that the recovery \"is as vigorous as possible.\" That kind of talk is raising hopes in the market. \"I think the market has reached a bottom,\" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, told CNBC\\'s \"Power Lunch,\" though using a long \"a\" in describing the situation. \"I think all the bad news we\\'re going to hear about the virus over the next four to six weeks, all the terrible economic data we\\'re going to see over the next four to six months, that has been priced in,\" he added. \"The next question for the market is what happens after ... we get to the fall and the economy starts to recover? Is it a \\'V\\' bottom recovery, or is it something that\\'s going to take a lot more time? Unfortunately, I\\'m in the latter camp.\"', 'author': ['Jeff Cox']}, {'link': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/executives-are-buying-stock-in-droves-giving-a-strong-signal-that-the-comeback-is-for-real.html', 'published': '2020-03-26T19:23:55', 'title': \"Executives are buying stock in droves, giving a 'strong' signal that the comeback is for real\", 'text': 'Dell CEO Michael Dell Getty Images\\n\\nExecutives are loading up on their company shares as the coronavirus-driven sell-off dents the broader market, signalling the heads of U.S. businesses are confident their companies will rebound.

Typically, that ratio is below 1, meaning more executives are selling stocks; however, the current positive ratio is a sign of corporate optimism and is bullish for equities and the future of the economy. Insider buying activity provides \"insight into which company insiders believe they have the liquidity to withstand a 1-2 month massive decline in economic activity and the solvency to withstand a \\'go forward\\' economy that is less robust than the one left behind,\" Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt said in a note to clients.

The bounce comes as C-suit employees are loading up. \"Insiders have a 35+ year track record of buying on the type of extreme weakness experienced in Q1\\'20,\" InsiderScore director of research Ben Silverman said in a note. \"A dramatic increase in insider buying volume combined with dampened levels of insider selling has resulted in the generation of industry buy inflections ‚Äì our strongest, quantitative macro signal ‚Äì for the entire market.\" Dell Technologies, the maker of PC computers, founder and CEO Michael Dell bought more than 800,000 shares worth $26.3 million last week, according to the Washington Service tracker. Shares of Dell are down about 40% from its recent high, which indicates Dell is expecting the stock to shoot up. Insiders likely wouldn\\'t be buying stock if they weren\\'t expecting healthy business on the other side of the virus turmoil, but they are long term shareholders. Raymond James said Dell is experiencing a pick-up in laptop orders due to the work-from-home trend. Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf bought about $5 million worth of stock and Planet Fitness chief Christopher Rondeau purchased about $4 million in stock earlier this month. Both stocks have lost about 40% of their values since the February highs. \"Insider sentiment turned positive during the February 24 market sell-off and has built since then.

Abdiel Capital, which owns more than 10% of Fastly, bought nearly $20 million of the computer services company\\'s stock last week. Blackstone bought more than $50 million of Cheniere Energy stock and JAB Holdings bought nearly $200 million of Keurig Dr. Pepper stock.

Last week ministers were widely criticised for fluctuating claims over the total number of tests that could be conducted each day, with Boris Johnson‚Äôs initial claim that 250,000 was possible superseded by Hancock‚Äôs promise to scale up to 100,000 a day by the end of April.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Hancock appeared to contradict himself over the production of the ventilators crucial to treatment of the most severe coronavirus cases, telling the BBC that there ‚Äúshould be another 1,500‚Äù in a week‚Äôs time before telling the Downing Street briefing ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt got an exact figure‚Äù.\\n\\nHe had announced the purchase of 3.5m antibody test kits on 24 March but a week later it emerged that they had not been bought, but rather had ‚Äúcontracts agreed subject to testing‚Äù.\\n\\nThe big range in immune response seen across the population also raises the troubling prospect that those who have had mild symptoms may not have long-term immunity against Covid-19.\\n\\nProf Marion Koopmans, head of virology at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, whose lab is assessing home testing kits in the Netherlands, said: ‚ÄúSo far, I‚Äôm not aware of any home tests that have passed our quality mark. Based on what I‚Äôve seen so far I‚Äôd be hesitant to give you an immunity passport based on a rapid test result.‚Äù\\n\\nA senior UK scientist who is working on lab-based antibody testing for Covid-19, said that given the current state of knowledge he was ‚Äúamazed the government had sufficient confidence‚Äù to go ahead with the purchase of millions of tests. ‚ÄúA lot of us did a double-take,‚Äù he said.\\n\\nAnother UK scientist said that none of the home test kits currently under evaluation in the UK were performing well enough, but did not give specific performance figures.\\n\\nLast month, Boris Johnson described the kits, which take as little as 20 minutes to use, as a potential ‚Äúgame changer‚Äù and their use is outlined in the government‚Äôs five pillar testing strategy. However, this weekend Hancock played down expectations, telling BBC One‚Äôs The Andrew Marr Show that there were no immediate plans to roll out antibody testing kits. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the test results through every day, I was looking at some last night,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we still don‚Äôt have any that are good enough.‚Äù\\n\\nEmerging evidence suggests that there is a wide range of antibody responses to coronavirus across the population, which may make the development of a simple, reliable home test that will work for everyone a considerable challenge.\\n\\nDr David Ho, a leading infectious disease specialist at Columbia University in New York, said that, based on patient samples analysed by his team, those with severe illness tend to develop a faster and stronger antibody response. In people with milder symptoms, the presence of antibodies in the blood tends to ramp up more slowly, meaning that tests need to performed later.\\n\\n‚ÄúThe problem is after a couple of weeks, the detection rate remains at about 50%-60%, especially in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases,‚Äù Ho said. ‚ÄúBut this may not be a fault of the tests, because even using more sensitive methods in the lab we can see the antibody levels are quite low.‚Äù\\n\\nIt is not yet clear whether this 50%-60% figure will improve much if people are tested three or four weeks after infection. To answer this, recovered patients need to be tracked for a longer period, but Koopmans is not optimistic that the detection rate will reach the levels seen in severe cases.\\n\\n‚ÄúThe sensitivity of these tests, I expect, will be relatively low,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you end up around 50%-60%. Even if they‚Äôre not that costly, why burn all those assays if that‚Äôs the information you get?‚Äù\\n\\nSome of the commercial home tests claim, in promotional materials, to have sensitivities above 90%. However, these figures are likely to be based on tests in patients recovering in hospital, who represent the most severe end of the spectrum in terms of symptoms. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this missing piece of how does it work in the 85% of people in the other category,‚Äù said Koopmans.\\n\\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ‚ÄúAntibody tests offer the hope that people who think they have had the disease will know they are immune and get back to life as normal. We are currently working with several companies who are offering these tests and are evaluating their effectiveness.\\n\\n‚ÄúThe Covid[-19] scientific advisory panel, led by Prof Sir John Bell, is currently undertaking a rapid evaluation process to establish their reliability.

Calderwood said she was ‚Äútruly sorry‚Äù for breaching her own advice not to travel, and acknowledged NHS staff had attacked her conduct.\\n\\n‚ÄúI have seen a lot of the comments from members of the public on Twitter today, people calling me a hypocrite, people telling me what hardships they have endured while following my guidance,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat I did was wrong, I‚Äôm very sorry.

Sturgeon refused to confirm or deny that she had, but hinted Calderwood had offered to step down and that her offer was rejected.\\n\\nShe said: ‚ÄúThe chief medical officer made clear to me she would do whatever she is required to do to in my judgment to be in the best interests of the country.

That included a visit to a nearby beach.\\n\\nWillie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader and a local MSP, said residents in the picturesque village were furious about an influx of second-home owners arriving there over the weekend.

The warm weather will bring welcome respite to lockdown Britain - and put pressure on authorities trying to control crowds and gatherings.\\n\\nHowever, scientists also believe warm weather could bring new insights into the virus by showing whether it reacts to the onset of spring. Flu epidemics tend to die out as winter ends; could sunshine, similarly, affect the behaviour of the coronavirus and its spread? It is a key question, and epidemiologists will be watching for changes very closely.\\n\\nInitial studies of other coronaviruses - the common varieties that cause colds in the UK - do suggest a seasonal pattern, with peaks occurring during winter and disappearing in spring. Intriguingly, these peaks tend to coincide with flu outbreaks. By contrast, only small amounts of coronavirus appear to be transmitted in the summer.\\n\\nThere is no deus ex machina to reach out of the clouds and put this right. We have to beat the virus ourselves. Ben Neuman, Reading University\\n\\nA key study of the common coronaviruses - HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E - was published last week by scientists at University College London. By analysing samples collected several years ago they found high rates of coronavirus infections in February, while in summer they were very low. Other studies have also shown coronaviruses are seasonal in behaviour in temperate climates.\\n\\nThe study‚Äôs lead author, Rob Aldridge, sounded a note of caution, however. ‚ÄúWe could see continued but lower levels of coronavirus transmission in summer but this may reverse in the winter if there is still a large susceptible population at that point,‚Äù he said.\\n\\n‚ÄúAnd given this is a novel virus, we don‚Äôt know if a seasonal pattern will hold over the summer given high levels of susceptibility in the population. For this reason, it is crucial that we all act now to follow current health advice.‚Äù\\n\\nThis point is backed stressed by other scientists, who warn that the Covid-19 virus is a completely new infectious agent and so there has been no chance for populations to build up any immunity. As a result, it is likely to continue to spread at current rates despite the onset of summer.\\n\\n‚ÄúI am sure seasonal variations in the virus‚Äôs behaviour will play a role in its spread,‚Äù said virologist Michael Skinner at Imperial College London. ‚ÄúBut compared with the effect we are having with social distancing, it will be a very minor influence. It may produce some marginal effects but these will not be a substitute for self-isolation.‚Äù\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Even in warmer weather, social distancing will remain the most effective way of containing the virus. Photograph: Isabel Infantes/Getty\\n\\nBen Neuman of Reading University was more emphatic. ‚ÄúThis virus started in near-freezing conditions in China, and is rapidly growing both in Iceland and on the equator in Brazil and Ecuador. As winter turned to spring, the virus growth has accelerated worldwide. This is not War of the Worlds, and there is no deus ex machina to reach out of the clouds and put this right. We have to beat the virus ourselves.‚Äù\\n\\nThe arrival of spring does not only affect the behaviour of a virus, however. It also produces changes in the human immune system, other researchers point out. ‚ÄúOur immune system displays a daily rhythm, but what is less known is how this varies from season to season,‚Äù said immunologist Natalie Riddell at Surrey University.\\n\\nTo find out, Riddell and other researchers at Surrey and Columbia Universities have been studying immune changes in humans at different seasons and different times of day. Biological samples were taken from volunteers at the winter and summer solstices and the spring and autumn equinoxes. Initial findings suggest a subset of white blood cells that play a key role in the immune system appear to be elevated at certain times of day, indicating that the system responds differently at varying times. For example, B cells that produce antibodies were found to be elevated at night.\\n\\nHowever, the impact of seasons on cell rhythms is still under investigation, added the study‚Äôs leader, Micaela Martinez of Columbia University. Results would be of considerable importance, she added. ‚ÄúKnowing the vulnerabilities of our body to diseases and viruses across the year could inform the timing of vaccination campaigns that will help us eradicate infections.‚Äù', 'author': ['Robin Mckie']}, {'link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready', 'published': '2020-04-05T11:06:39', 'title': 'When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready?', 'text': 'Human trials will begin imminently ‚Äì but even if they go well and a cure is found, there are many barriers before global immunisation is feasible\\n\\nEven at their most effective ‚Äì and draconian ‚Äì containment strategies have only slowed the spread of the respiratory disease Covid-19. With the World Health Organization finally declaring a pandemic, all eyes have turned to the prospect of a vaccine, because only a vaccine can prevent people from getting sick.\\n\\nAbout 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create such a vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates they have been testing in animals. The first of these ‚Äì produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna ‚Äì will enter human trials imminently.\\n\\nThis unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.\\n\\nBut there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus ‚Äì flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk ‚Äì vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on ‚Äúprototype‚Äù pathogens. ‚ÄúThe speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,‚Äù says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development.\\n\\nCoronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics ‚Äì severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in 2002-04, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for Sars-CoV-2, and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.\\n\\nSars-CoV-2 shares between 80% and 90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused Sars ‚Äì hence its name. Both consist of a strip of ribonucleic acid (RNA) inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung ‚Äì the same type of receptor in both cases ‚Äì allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell‚Äôs reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process.\\n\\nAll vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form.\\n\\nTraditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the Covid-19 vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy ‚Äì the one that Novavax is using, for example ‚Äì constructs a ‚Äúrecombinant‚Äù vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of Sars-CoV-2, which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast ‚Äì forcing these microorganisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and another company which has a presence in Boston, CureVac, both of which are building Covid-19 vaccines out of messenger RNA.\\n\\nCepi‚Äôs original portfolio of four funded Covid-19 vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, and last week it announced $4.4m (¬£3.4m) of partnership funding with Novavax and with a University of Oxford vectored vaccine project. ‚ÄúOur experience with vaccine development is that you can‚Äôt anticipate where you‚Äôre going to stumble,‚Äù says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials, which, for some of the candidates, are about to get under way.\\n\\nClinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But there‚Äôs a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. ‚ÄúNot all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,‚Äù says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based nonprofit, the Sabin Vaccine Institute.\\n\\nThere are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or they‚Äôre ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials can‚Äôt be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material ‚Äì RNA or DNA ‚Äì has been approved to date, for example. So the Covid-19 vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: ‚ÄúWhile there is a push to do things as fast as possible, it‚Äôs really important not to take shortcuts.‚Äù\\n\\nAn illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for Sars-CoV-2, it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why President Trump sowed confusion when, at a meeting at the White House on 2 March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November ‚Äì an impossible deadline. ‚ÄúLike most vaccinologists, I don‚Äôt think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,‚Äù says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That‚Äôs already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches.\\n\\nIn the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, it‚Äôs going to be needed in vast quantities ‚Äì and many of the organisations in the Covid-19 vaccine race simply don‚Äôt have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you don‚Äôt yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a Covid-19 vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and earlier this month it put out a call for $2bn to allow it to do so.\\n\\nOnce a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. ‚ÄúGetting a vaccine that‚Äôs proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what‚Äôs needed for a global immunisation programme,‚Äù says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics (2018). ‚ÄúVirus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.‚Äù\\n\\nThe problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk ‚Äì including children and pregnant women ‚Äì with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines.\\n\\nBecause pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India ‚Äì a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world ‚Äì not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own 1.3 billion-strong population first, before exporting any.\\n\\nOutside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes ‚Äì leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: ‚ÄúThe question is, what will happen in a situation where you‚Äôve got national emergencies going on?‚Äù\\n\\nThis is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. The pandemic, says Wilder-Smith, ‚Äúwill probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is available‚Äù. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating ‚Äì like flu ‚Äì and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to contain the disease as far as possible. To repeat the sage advice: wash your hands.\\n\\nThis article was amended on 19 March 2020.

This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.\\n\\n‚ÄúBut if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.\\n\\n‚ÄúIf they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs that are at the bottom of our lungs.‚Äù\\n\\nIf the air sacs then become inflamed, Wilson says this causes an ‚Äúoutpouring of inflammatory material [fluid and inflammatory cells] into the lungs and we end up with pneumonia.‚Äù\\n\\nHe says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body‚Äôs ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,‚Äù he says.\\n\\nCoronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state Read more\\n\\nHow can the pneumonia be treated?\\n\\nProf Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told Guardian Australia: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, so far we don‚Äôt have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.\\n\\n‚ÄúPeople are already trialling all sorts of medications and we‚Äôre hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn‚Äôt any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.‚Äù\\n\\nWilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.\\n\\n‚ÄúIn some situations that isn‚Äôt enough,‚Äù he says of the current outbreak. ‚ÄúThe pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.‚Äù\\n\\nCoronavirus UK: how many confirmed cases are in your area?

Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.\\n\\nHe says: ‚ÄúOnce we have an infection in the lung and, if it involves the air sacs, then the body‚Äôs response is first to try and destroy [the virus] and limit its replication.‚Äù\\n\\nBut Wilson says this ‚Äúfirst responder mechanism‚Äù can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.\\n\\nJenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.\\n\\n‚ÄúAge is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.‚Äù\", 'author': ['Graham Readfearn']}, {'link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/police-investigate-uk-far-right-groups-over-anti-muslim-coronavirus-claims', 'published': '2020-04-05T14:53:03', 'title': 'Police investigate UK far-right groups over anti-Muslim coronavirus claims', 'text': 'Monitoring service says it has had reports of fake news online as well as physical attacks\\n\\nCounter-terrorism police in the UK are investigating far-right groups accused of trying to use the coronavirus crisis to stoke anti-Muslim sentiment.\\n\\nThe monitoring group Tell Mama said that in March it recorded dozens of incidents of far-right groups allegedly trying to put blame on British Muslims for the spread of the virus.\\n\\nThe group said it had had to debunk numerous claims made on social media that Muslims were breaching the lockdown by continuing to attend mosques to pray.

One third of Stockholm‚Äôs nursing homes are affected.\\n\\nAlthough Sweden has closed senior high schools and banned gatherings of more than 50 people, the prime minister, Stefan L√∂fven, has preferred to rely on Swedes‚Äô sense of civic responsibility, asking rather than ordering them to avoid non-essential travel, to work from home and to stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill.\\n\\n‚ÄúEveryone is responsible for their own wellbeing, for their neighbours‚Äô and for their own local community,‚Äù the foreign minister, Ann Linde, said last week. ‚ÄúThis applies in a normal situation and it applies in a crisis situation.‚Äù\\n\\nThe approach has so far proved popular among voters, with 44% of respondents in a survey published last week saying they trusted L√∂fven, compared with 26% in February. But while Stockholm is estimated to be 70% less busy than usual, an analysis of smartphone location data showed that while visits to public places had fallen steeply in most European countries, Sweden was bucking the trend.\\n\\nThe strategy has come under increasingly heavy fire from some of the country‚Äôs health experts. Stefan Hanson, a Swedish infectious diseases expert, said the situation was not lost in the whole country, with large parts of the south and north so far displaying low infections rates.\\n\\n‚ÄúBut in Stockholm it is fast becoming critical,‚Äù Hanson said. ‚ÄúThere is a real risk now that cases will rise so high that the hospitals cannot cope.

Last week the CDC in the US issued guidance recommending wearing a mask in public spaces. Trump has shrugged off the advice so far, saying: ‚ÄúThis is voluntary. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be doing it.‚Äù\\n\\nFrench and German officials blamed the US last week for using ‚Äúwild west‚Äù tactics to outbid them, but Crotty said the outbidding appeared to be an all-against-all affair.\\n\\nOver the weekend authorities in Berlin withdrew a claim that the US had ‚Äúseized‚Äù a shipment of 200,000 respirator masks ordered for the city‚Äôs police force, a claim that led to an accusation of ‚Äúmodern piracy‚Äù from Berlin‚Äôs state interior minister, Andreas Geisel.\\n\\nAccording to Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, the police now say they were outbid while the respirators were in transit at Bangkok airport. The Berlin authorities say it is unclear where they went and who the ultimate buyer was.\\n\\nDer Tagesspiegel reported that the masks were made by the US manufacturer 3M, but it has denied any involvement in the transaction.\\n\\nThe company has come under intense public pressure from Trump in recent days for continuing to supply masks to other countries. On Thursday he invoked the Federal Production Act, which dates back to the Korean war era and has given the administration the right to use ‚Äúany and all authority‚Äù to procure the protective equipment it needs.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe need the masks.

(The European equivalent is the FFP2 respirator.)\\n\\nAt the same time, stung by widespread reports of shoddy masks imported from China, Beijing took action to regulate producers. However, Crotty said the effect of the regulation has been to cut off supply. Beijing is only giving certification to companies that have previously sold on the Chinese domestic market, but Crotty said four-fifth of the factories he dealt with manufacture solely for the export market.\\n\\n‚ÄúOnly 20% might have these certificates, so of course they‚Äôre going to raise prices higher,‚Äù he said. But he added that masks without certification could still be exported if they were labelled for personal or commercial use only.\\n\\nCrotty said everyone involved in the market was trying to improvise in unique circumstances. ‚ÄúNone of us have ever seen anything like this.

Wisely, she kept it short and sweet. This wasn‚Äôt a Christmas message when half the country would be pissed and the other half wouldn‚Äôt be listening. Now every sentence would be picked over and every word would count.\\n\\nThe Queen began by acknowledging the challenges everyone was facing: death; financial hardship (some more than others, when it comes to the royal family); and separation, before going on to praise the selflessness of those in the NHS and other frontline emergency services. She then said how much she hoped people would maintain the self-sacrifice, self-discipline, compassion and sense of humour needed to defeat the illness.\\n\\nOn the hottest weekend of the year so far, this rang a little hollow as most of the country appeared to have gone outdoors with the sole purpose of snitching on any people they came across who weren‚Äôt keeping the appropriate safe distance from one another. B&Q have had a massive run on tape measures in the past week. It won‚Äôt be long before there‚Äôs also a black market in tasers to take out sweaty joggers.\\n\\nAfter a nod to the Commonwealth and the global nature of the pandemic ‚Äì this wasn‚Äôt the plucky Brits taking on the might of Nazi Germany singlehandedly in 1940 ‚Äì the Queen mentioned a previous address she and Princess Margaret had made to the nation in 1940. Still, she could be forgiven the solipsism as she had done her bit during the second world war, having spent the latter years of the war driving military trucks. As yet there were no promises to turn any of the royal palaces into field hospitals or emergency supply depots, though she might be holding that in reserve for another day.\\n\\nThe Queen ended with a promise that better days would one day return and that in the meantime we should hold our nerve and do our best to be the generation of which future ones would be proud. We can but hope. She even came over a bit Vera Lynn, promising us ‚Äúwe‚Äôll meet again‚Äù. Only without the singing. Small mercies. Maybe next time. Given the circumstances, it had been more or less a pitch perfect speech. After all there‚Äôs only a certain amount a head of state can say at times like these.\\n\\nBut one thing was notable by its absence. Although it‚Äôs her job to be apolitical, there was no mention of the government‚Äôs efforts or requests to follow official advice. Her Maj still hasn‚Äôt forgotten how she was used, and made a fool of, by Boris Johnson over the prorogation and pointless Queen‚Äôs speech. In Boris, she doesn‚Äôt trust. But then who does?\\n\\nThe subtext was unmistakeable. If the country was to survive, it would do so through the collective resolve of its people, not through a government that had been slow to react and was still making promises it did not know it would be able to keep.

Who will speak for the country? | John Harris', 'text': \"Last week, Boris Johnson stood on a set of stairs inside 10 Downing Street and spoke into a smartphone camera. Towards the end of a two-and-half minute monologue about Covid-19 and the national response to it, he said something striking: ‚ÄúOne thing I think [the] coronavirus crisis has already proved is that there really is such a thing as society.‚Äù\\n\\nThe words, if anyone missed the reference, were an allusion to an infamous few sentences from Margaret Thatcher, published in an interview in Woman‚Äôs Own magazine in 1987: ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it‚Äôs the government‚Äôs job to cope with it ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre casting their problem on society. And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first.‚Äù\\n\\nThough Johnson may well have cited what she said to create a useful distraction among political journalists, what he said nonetheless highlighted something undeniable: that Conservative politicians used to following Thatcher‚Äôs example are suddenly having to behave in ways that will be causing some of them no end of unease.\\n\\nIn the spectacle of the chancellor Rishi Sunak‚Äôs huge economic interventions and the government‚Äôs sudden veneration of the public sector, you can discern Tory shibboleths being suddenly thrown overboard. But things are perhaps more complicated than they appear. Coronavirus will force shifts in policy of a scale no Tory politician would ever have foreseen, but they also chime with underrated things that have been present in post-Thatcher Conservatism for years. When David Cameron was in charge, there were periodic fits of interest in a more socially minded Toryism, and the idea of the Conservatives somehow becoming a ‚Äúworkers‚Äô party‚Äù. Before she was waylaid by Brexit, Theresa May spoke about the need for an activist state. Just before the arrival of Covid-19, when all the talk was of big infrastructure projects and helping places in the so-called ‚Äúred wall‚Äù, cabinet ministers were doing much the same.\\n\\nTrust is essential in these times. But Boris Johnson is not a man to be trusted Read more\\n\\nOf course austerity went on, inequalities were still ignored, and our exit from the EU quickly proved to be a huge distraction from the dire state of our social fabric. But in the midst of a sudden, unprecedented crisis, that is not quite the point. What matters right now is that much of the political groundwork has been done for Johnson and his allies to move away from free-market dogma, and in any case, they have no choice.\\n\\nAs and when we start to emerge from the coronavirus period, I would imagine we will be hearing a great deal about a new kind of Conservatism, and the supposed end of a Tory approach to governing that lasted 40 long years, from 1979 to 2019. This may not be nearly as benign as it might sound: from increased surveillance to the closing of national borders, there are things lurking in this moment that play to the authoritarian part of the Tory soul, and they need to be closely watched. But make no mistake: a new political common sense will emerge from the crisis, and it will surely mark the start of a different era.\\n\\nTwo days after the close of the Labour leadership contest, where does that leave Keir Starmer? To some extent, the huge shift in Tory thinking will be helpful: if Ed Miliband‚Äôs attempts to shift debate after the 2008 crash were always stifled by the tyranny of austerity, and Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs push left was stymied by basic unelectability,in times like these, a halfway competent Labour leader ought to be able to make the case for ambitious social democracy. That said, Starmer will have to avoid politicking for its own sake and the dire kind of ‚Äúthis proves me right‚Äù stuff recently attempted by his predecessor. For now, some of his job will come down to calmly pointing out the inevitable gaps between the Conservatives‚Äô words and realities on the ground, and keeping a close eye on both the government‚Äôs propensity for incompetence, and Covid-19‚Äôs more sinister consequences. He ought to be good at those things; it would be strange if he were not.\\n\\nBut there is another, altogether more onerous challenge. One big thing is lacking from the government‚Äôs relationship with Britain, and it is time this was pointed out. Whatever its policy shifts, the Johnson administration has so far failed to speak to the country as a national community, and invoke a convincing idea of ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù.\\n\\nOne of the great political tragedies of the last decade or so was the way people on the right were allowed to run away with ideas about the United Kingdom ‚Äì and, perhaps more importantly, England ‚Äì and frame them in terms of a crabby, inward-looking set of prejudices. In the hands of so many Brexiteers, ‚Äúwe‚Äù became synonymous with a monocultural notion of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù, and patriotism was held to be the exclusive property of their own tribe.\\n\\nThe left, particularly under Corbyn, did what it usually does, and for fear of having to come up with ideas of belonging and nationhood that could include diversity and openness, vacated the pitch. The right, meanwhile, developed the kind of nasty, polarising, warlike vocabulary, such as ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù, and all that stuff, which the prime minister used throughout his opening months in the job. This, coupled with his libertarian mistrust of the state, means Johnson is now doing things that clash with his most basic instincts, which is why he has not seemed able to speak to the country as a whole.\\n\\nIn an age of mass scepticism and irreverence, and with the UK drifting apart, perhaps no politician could convincingly adopt the mantle of a national leader. There again, there is a collective, communitarian spirit woven through this awful crisis ‚Äì and if politics is to meaningfully speak to us, sooner or later, that spirit will demand to be voiced by people who are either in high office, or who aspire to it.\\n\\nPlay Video Keir Starmer's Labour leadership acceptance speech in full ‚Äì video\\n\\nAspects of our national life are suddenly in the foreground ‚Äì from the NHS, through all those low-paid key workers, to spontaneous community initiatives that transcend most of the social divides we were told were insurmountable. If the Conservatives cannot turn them into a national story, someone else should at least try ‚Äì not for immediate electoral gain, but for two other reasons. In the short-term, it could help many of us to get out of bed every morning and face the day. Looking further ahead, it might start to map out what kind of country we might become when the horrors of the coronavirus begin to recede.\\n\\nOn the evidence of the past few months, Starmer may be too bloodless and cautious a politician to pull this off. Maybe his remainer convictions, and widespread mistrust of his party, will deny him a big enough audience. But in the speech released as his victory was announced, there were at least hints of what the moment requires: the elegant recognition that in the midst of the crisis, ‚Äútoo many will have given too much‚Äù and ‚Äúsome of us will have lost too much‚Äù; the unanswerable claim that ‚Äúwe know, in our hearts, [that] things are going to have to change.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúSo many volunteering for the NHS, millions of people doing their bit to stop this virus and to save lives,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long.‚Äù With modesty and humility at first, he needs to develop this voice.

How is this best managed?\\n\\nAn early example of the issue came on Wednesday 18 March, when the travel desk published an article just ahead of Mother‚Äôs Day in the UK, recommending National Trust parks suitable for walks while social distancing. As fresh air and exercise were still encouraged, this piece was designed to steer people towards less crowded spots.\\n\\nThree days later, the National Trust closed its parks and gardens after the government announced more stringent measures. For the best of motives, the article was deleted. Risk had been removed but so had something else. When the story of coronavirus comes to be told, to see how a parkland stroll was recommended on Wednesday but off-limits by Saturday will offer a glimpse into the extent of uncertainty in March 2020.\\n\\nScale this up across all reporting of a constantly evolving crisis ‚Äì one in which national and international response will be scrutinised for clues to handling any future crisis ‚Äì and you see why the chronicle matters.\\n\\nFollowing discussion with senior staff, the National Trust feature was reinstated with prominent labelling and an amended headline. It meant a reader could not wander into the article on a misapprehension but neither had the Guardian hidden its own footsteps. This approach is now taken on a case-by-case basis when any potentially misleading Covid-19 article is identified.\\n\\nThe principle regarding removals also applies to rewrites. But every rule needs an exception and in exceptional times one has been made for Covid-19 ‚Äúexplainers‚Äù. These articles ‚Äì some of which have received tens of millions of views ‚Äì answer questions such as which symptoms require medical attention, when will a vaccine be ready and which countries have travel restrictions in place. To help readers find the most recent advice, some are regularly updated and republished to take account of new statistics, new information or new questions.\\n\\nHowever, last week one reader asked anxiously whether a revised explainer meant something vital had been wrong in the original. Her question prompted internal discussion and there will now be a paragraph at the end of such pieces explaining the purpose of updates and that any significant corrections will be footnoted in the usual way.\\n\\nPraise for the journalism has been terrific (‚Äúthorough, intelligent and filled with empathy‚Äù; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm relying on my online Guardian more than ever in lockdown‚Äù; ‚ÄúThank you for all that you are continuing to do to get the paper out to us in this difficult time‚Äù ‚Äì to give a flavour).

Although that picture of a train car marked ‚ÄúCovid-19‚Äù did somehow make its way onto the family thread. Tweets about parents spreading fake news about how to cure Covid-19 have become a meme in themselves. Like a virus within a virus are the screenshots of mums telling their adult kids to binge-eat garlic, huff bleach or ‚Äì according to one viral tweet ‚Äì ‚Äúput an onion in the corner of every room in the house‚Äù.\\n\\n‚ÄúMy mum has a PhD on coronavirus from WhatsApp university,‚Äù tweeted one user.

My partner regularly has to tell off her 75-year-old dad for his factually dubious forwarded emails. (Although his latest offering, with the subject line √Ä m√©diter, is actually a thoughtful essay on the pandemic, which originally appeared in Le Monde. My French isn‚Äôt good enough to understand the full text, but an uninformed glance tells me it‚Äôs deeply existential.)\\n\\nThere appear to be three types of pandemic parent: the insouciant, the paranoid and the contemplative. Some straddle all three. The insouciant needs to be begged to stop going to the pub, but also creates the best content: the dads dancing with their teenage daughters on TikTok, the mums of younger kids churning out funny tweets about home-schooling. In one TikTok video, a dad acts as a bouncer and a mum a bartender, having turned their garage into a nightclub for their son‚Äôs 21st birthday. These creatively supercharged boomers are ‚Äì dare I say it ‚Äì making lockdown slightly less terrible. They‚Äôre trying so hard to ‚Äúmake the best of a bad situation‚Äù and ‚Äúlive, laugh, love‚Äù their way through it that ‚Äì you have to hand it to them ‚Äì they‚Äôre kind of succeeding. Or at least allowing us to forget about the slow collapse of civilisation in viral, 30-second blasts.\\n\\nCoronaviral: the best memes, tweets and cartoons to get you through ‚Äì open thread Read more\\n\\nIn the past few weeks, we‚Äôve all seen those irritating references to the great works of art and literature supposedly created during quarantine, such as Shakespeare‚Äôs King Lear. What if that video of a dad pretending to be Basil Fawlty while serving his kids dinner is quarantine‚Äôs King Lear? There‚Äôs certainly nothing more reflective of the zeitgeist than stir-crazy parents dispensing with their inhibitions; parents in lockdown are doing the ‚Äúlong suffering but cheerful‚Äù thing like never before. This is their time to shine, and we should probably just sit back and enjoy the results.\\n\\nThe contemplative parents don‚Äôt require as much attention. They‚Äôre too busy zenning out to memes, or reading French essays. And even the paranoid parents deserve a break. After all, they‚Äôre just trying to help, even if their idea of ‚Äúhelping‚Äù happens to be sourcing all of their information on a gravely urgent situation from satirical news sites and anti-vaxx forums.

It surfaced from time to time over the decades and added to Brunel‚Äôs legend as a genius with a mischievous sense of humour.\\n\\nIn April 2017 the line was shut because of engineering work, providing Great Western Railway and Network Rail with a rare chance to observe whether the sun really does shine through the length of the tunnel on 9 April. Teams positioned themselves at the eastern and western ends of the tunnel and waited for the sun to rise. Disappointingly, they had to conclude that it did not quite beam all the way through.\\n\\nThis was no surprise to Maggs and others who have analysed the science and concluded that in fact a more probable date for the phenomenon was 6 or 7 April. So he took a different tack. ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd come at it another way ‚Äì from the social angle rather than the scientific one,‚Äù he said.\\n\\nMaggs began to investigate Brunel‚Äôs life and times to try to find out whether 6 or 7 April were significant dates for him. Eventually he tracked down Emma Joan‚Äôs baptism certificate, which gave her date of birth as 6 April 1803.\\n\\nBrunel‚Äôs older sister, Sophia, was known as a spirited and powerful woman, but Emma Joan tends to be forgotten and was dismissed by an early Brunel biographer as ‚Äúdim and rather ailing‚Äù.\\n\\nMaggs, from Chelmsford, Essex, likes the idea that Brunel might have paid tribute to his younger sister by designing in a trick of the light.\\n\\nBut might it just be coincidence? ‚ÄúAs to whether he really intended it, I reckon it‚Äôs 50/50,‚Äù said Maggs. ‚ÄúBut the fact remains he did have a great sense of fun. It is possible. If he had done it for his birthday and he had been found out he would have come under a load of opprobrium from shareholders.

But, two years on, the Canadian experiment hasn‚Äôt quite turned out as we reformers had hoped.\\n\\nThe Gatineau greenhouse through which I strode on that day in 2017 was owned by a firm called the Hydropothecary. Now named Hexo, in October 2019 it shed 200 of its 800 staff. On 4 March one of Canada‚Äôs biggest growers, Canopy Growth, announced the closure of two mega-greenhouses in the towns of Delta and Aldegrove ‚Äì with 500 job losses. The firm also cancelled the opening of a new site in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the black market is still vibrant while cannabis stocks have crashed, medical patients say they can‚Äôt get hold of essential medicines, and thousands of jobs have been lost. So what went wrong ‚Äì and what went right? Were cannabis activists‚Äô hopes of a regulated cannabis market just a pipe dream?\\n\\nCanada had permitted cannabis for medical use since 2001. Medical patients were allowed to grow four plants, and licensed producers cultivated larger crops for sale online to those with valid prescriptions. But most Canadian cities had illegal ‚Äì but tolerated ‚Äì dispensaries where the drug was sold completely indiscriminately. These stores made Amsterdam‚Äôs coffee shops look as prim as a WI cake stand. The quality and variety of cannabis on sale at these illegal outlets was outstanding, bewildering. Business was not just booming, but blazing.And it was all completely illegal.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‚ÄòCanada made cannabis boring‚Äô: plants being tended at Aurora. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nCanada‚Äôs Cannabis Act of 2018 was a bold attempt to impose some order on this anarchic retail scene. It legalised the sale to adults of 30g of cannabis in austere packaging from government-licensed shops. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said: ‚ÄúThe old approach to cannabis didn‚Äôt work. It was too easy for our kids to get it and gangs and drug dealers were reaping the profits. That changes from now on.‚Äù\\n\\nBill Blair, a former Toronto police chief, became an unlikely cheerleader for legalisation, arguing that to do so would ‚Äúkeep cannabis out of the hands of youth, and profits out of the hands of criminals‚Äù. Two other key goals of regulation were the protection of public health and the reduction in criminality associated with the illegal market. After 50 years of the unending, senseless drug war, peace had broken out.\\n\\nOr so it seemed. Because while Canada may have lit the fuse on an ambitious experiment, every high has a low. Within a year the industry was experiencing mass layoffs, multi-billion-dollar stock-market losses, executive firings and corporate scandals as the overhyped new sector experienced a dramatic and humbling public correction.\\n\\nWhat went wrong? Alastair Moore, co-founder of Hanway Associates, a London-based cannabis consultancy, says the Canadian industry has been driven by vulture capitalism and wishful thinking. ‚ÄúA mix of greed and naivety led this industry to great heights ‚Äì and has left it on its knees. While some made lots of money, others lost their investments and now many others have lost their jobs.‚Äù\\n\\nAccording to Moore‚Äôs fellow founder, George McBride: ‚ÄúThe key thing is that Canada did actually get the reforms through. In and of itself, that is a huge feat. It‚Äôs the first time any major developed country has done so. And so, kudos. However, getting it through has involved a lot of politicians who didn‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre talking about designing a really complicated system.‚Äù\\n\\nSo just how does a state create and regulate an entirely new business of intoxication that has always existed, essentially, in a countercultural, outlaw space? Canada, it turns out, did so cautiously, with every decision deliberated over by a centralised government Task Force.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Green green grass of home: plants at Strathroy, Ontario, Canada. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nAdded to the complexity of the policy and its implementation, the needle of international capital‚Äôs wonky moral compass swung straight at these lucrative new markets. Hundreds of millions of dollars were raised on global capital markets and the Canadian landscape was quickly dotted with massive new grow sites.\\n\\nThe so-called ‚Äúgreen rush‚Äù had started and production went into overdrive. Stock prices soared and fortunes were staked, made, doubled and tripled in an atmosphere reminiscent of the 90s dotcom boom, or the Yukon gold rush of the 19th century, when 100,000 prospectors headed into the Canadian hinterlands in search of riches. Many firms hoped to corner the Canadian market by throwing millions of dollars of shareholders‚Äô money into massive grow sites. This time, the gold was green. But soon, things started to fall apart.\\n\\nThe main problem Canada‚Äôs smokers and growers faced was access: too few retail shops were able to open to serve the eager new market. Canada is a country of 38 million people, divided into 10 provinces that are similar to US states, with provincial governments producing a patchwork of varying regulations. Over a third ‚Äì 13.5 million ‚Äì of all Canadians live in the state of Ontario. But as of 2 March this year, Ontario had just 41 retail cannabis stores. The province of Alberta, home to 4.4 million, has 423 stores.\\n\\nAnd where there was product available, the price was almost double that of the illegal market. C$5.59 to C$10.23 per gram (or over ¬£40 a quarter ounce). That was caused by tax burdens and overheads: the legal market has to comply with regulations on fungicide and pesticide residue levels, and draconian security requirements for grow sites, such as huge vaults in which to store the cannabis and record-keeping for every person who enters these vaults.\\n\\nThe illegal market, meanwhile, is completely unregulated ‚Äì and thriving because of this. Statistics Canada, a state agency, reports that just 29% of cannabis users buy all of their product from a legal source. Four in 10 Canadians told the organisation that they bought at least some cannabis from illegal sources in 2019.\\n\\nThe next problem was that many stores sold poor-quality grass, with smokers complaining that it had been poorly dried and cured, and tasted bad. Modern cannabis users are accustomed to a range of flavours, from lemon to mango, pineapple, strawberry and pine. These flavours are derived from the plant‚Äôs natural aroma profile, which skilled growers preserve by careful breeding, correct harvesting and slow, cautious curing of the fragrant flowers.\\n\\nMany players in the new mass market often skipped these steps in the pursuit of profit, says David Brown, a British Columbia-based cannabis industry analyst. ‚ÄúMany consumers have had complaints about high prices and what is perceived as lower quality, especially the tendency of many of the legal dried flower products to be overly dried, often from a rushed or improper curing and drying process.‚Äù\\n\\nWhy would anyone drive a few miles up the road to score bad weed from many of the government shops when your regular black-market dealer lives nearby, has better product and brings it to your door for half the price?\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The nose knows: a customer sniffs display samples at Evergreen Cannabis in Vancouver. Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP\\n\\nIt‚Äôs worth reflecting, also, on the psychology of some of these users. ‚ÄúFor a long time, cannabis has been the mark of the rebel, the outsider, the outlaw,‚Äù says Brown. ‚ÄúA lot of the people who complain about ‚Äòbad weed‚Äô and so-called ‚Äòfake legalisation‚Äô are doing so because parts of their countercultural identity have been altered forever by this law change. Canada has made cannabis boring ‚Äì and that was kind of the point.‚Äù\\n\\nWith few shops to sell to and customers clinging to their traditional dealers, the new cannabis corporations found themselves holding a glut of product. There is a stockpile of grass weighing in at 400 tonnes, at last count, according to official government inventory figures.\\n\\nThe rollout of retail shops was left, in many cases, to inexperienced officials in provincial government departments, says McBride. ‚ÄúOntario authorities said, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt trust private organisations to run cannabis shops. We‚Äôre going to do it all ourselves.‚Äô Then they tried to do it, but they squandered about $80 million trying to figure out how to do it, and got absolutely nowhere. They had to cancel it and invite private tenders. All these big, shiny grow facilities that cost C$10m, C$20m or C$30m to build, and which all grew loads of cannabis ‚Äì there was nowhere to sell it, because there weren‚Äôt any shops,‚Äù he says.\\n\\nIn a stinging irony, medical patients ‚Äì the very people whose decades of activism had driven the wider reforms, faced cannabis shortages and a steep increase in price after legalisation as suppliers diverted their medical product in bulk to the new recreational market rather than in hundreds of smaller deals to medical patients.\\n\\nDan Sutton of Tantalus Labs, a British Columbia-based grower that uses natural sunlight and greenhouses, says legalisation has been ‚Äúlargely negative‚Äù for medical cannabis users because of this new sales dynamic: ‚ÄúPhysicians have been telling medical users they should buy from the recreational marketplace, which is completely inappropriate ‚Äì and it loads them up with extra taxes and tariffs.‚Äù\\n\\nSutton originally built his low-impact, sunlit grow to service medical users, and still focuses on this original customer base ‚Äì though they make up just 10% of his sales. ‚ÄúMany licensed producers now don‚Äôt,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSome have just pulled their financial resources on their medical platforms. If a medical user can‚Äôt get their medicine ‚Äì for people, with, say, multiple sclerosis ‚Äì that can lead to severe impairment, traffic accidents and potentially death. That blood is on those licensed producers‚Äô hands that stopped serving those users‚Äô needs,‚Äù he says.\\n\\nPaul North, director of communications at Volteface, which commissioned me to write the paper, says Canadian customers‚Äô response to the malfunctioning new markets is understandable: ‚ÄúYou have to provide a superior experience to the illicit market. When it comes to cannabis, this is not easy. Dealers have no marketing restrictions, and can offer a sweet deal and deliver a product to your door. For most people, cannabis use is a relaxing, problem-free and enjoyable experience. Buying the drug needs to match that experience, and; until it does, the illicit market will continue.‚Äù\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Product placement: cannabis pills ready for sale in Quebec. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nHype talks, but money walks. The early euphoria in the cannabis stock market has been replaced by a major dose of paranoia. All cannabis stocks have tanked, with an average 50% wipeout in value right across Canada and the US in the last year. Major players such as Aurora Cannabis took the biggest hit, with its shares falling from US$12.83 in March 2019 to US$2 today. Another bud behemoth, Tilray, has also had its share price slashed by 80%, from over US$81 to US$16 within a year. Other cannabis giants including Aphria lost 60% of their paper value in 2019, while Canopy Growth sank by 54%. Financing has dried up for the new industry, and small-scale retail investors ‚Äì often young professionals investing via smartphone apps ‚Äì have lost large sums of money. None of this is to assert that Canada‚Äôs policy has been a failure. If we compare it to the UK cannabis industry, where illegally trafficked children have been found enslaved in abandoned buildings growing cannabis for gangsters, it is better by several orders of magnitude.\\n\\nSteve Rolles of UK-based drug law reform group Transform agrees that it is harsh to judge the project‚Äôs success so soon. ‚ÄúWe are still in the rollout phase. They are still in a transition from an illegal economy to a legally regulated one. It will take some time for new market equilibrium to be established, and for new social norms to emerge, and for teething problems to be addressed.‚Äù\\n\\nBig, shiny grow facilities cost C$20m or C$30m to build and grew loads of cannabis ‚Äì but there was nowhere to sell it\\n\\nHow best to create a legal cannabis industry is a question with a particular urgency in the UK today as we build a market for medicinal use ‚Äì albeit agonisingly slowly. I strongly believe that cannabis will be legalised for adult use in the UK within five years. And it all goes back to that Gatineau greenhouse I visited in 2017.\\n\\nOn that trip, I was accompanied by two Tory party insiders, Blair Gibbs, ex-adviser on police matters to Boris Johnson when he was mayor, and Danny Kruger, son of TV chef Prue Leith, who wrote the ‚Äúhug a hoodie‚Äù speech for David Cameron. Both men experienced something of a Damascene conversion in their views on cannabis law during that trip. Days after his return, Kruger wrote in the Spectator: ‚ÄúWe do not need to ban everything bad. After all, the Victorians never prohibited alcohol. They regulated it, taxed it and hedged it about with a culture of disapproval. Instead of the prohibition of cannabis we need an old Victorian virtue: temperance.‚Äù\\n\\nBlair Gibbs moved to Canada in 2017 to work as a cannabis consultant, but in August 2019 he took a job in the PM‚Äôs office. Both men are now at the very heart of the British government: in 2019 Kruger was parachuted into the safe Tory seat of Devizes to stand as MP in the last election and is also an adviser to Johnson.\\n\\nWhether their weed-friendly outlook survives the cold glare of Whitehall orthodoxy remains to be seen. But it is undeniable that the economic libertarians of the Tory party in 2020 are much more pro-cannabis than their newly nationalising Labour party counterparts. There are, after all, many billions of pounds to be made by the kind of people who fund the Tories: land and property owners and the banks that will finance the new industry.\\n\\nWhat happens if you just legalise this drug? It‚Äôs a question no one other than Canada has ever really asked. My view is that we have long known that all drug laws are unworkable, illogical, unjustifiable, unscientific, counterproductive and generate countless unintended consequences ‚Äì in fact, drugs laws often create the exact opposite outcomes to those desired. But ironically, and with a beautifully stoned logic, it turns out that legalising cannabis in Canada has generated just as many challenges as it solved.\\n\\nWhat Canada‚Äôs experience demonstrates is that cannabis legalisation does not instantly deliver some great social panacea. There is no promised land. But we should never lose sight of this essential truth: Canadians can no longer be jailed for growing and eating and smoking certain flowers. That is a huge, fundamental step forward, no matter what the stock market indices say.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the market vagaries and the slow shrinking of the illegal market, analyst Andrew Brown is still proud of his country‚Äôs bold step into the unknown. ‚ÄúLegalisation in Canada is hardly perfect. After all, we‚Äôre less than two years into legalising a product that has been illegal for nearly a century,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThis is a process, not a destination, and the slow, deliberate approach to a well-regulated industry is allowing Canada to set a responsible path forward that other countries can feel safe in following, even refining and improving upon.‚Äù', 'author': ['Mike Power']}, {'link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/05/open-your-windows-and-four-other-ways-to-improve-the-air-quality-at-home', 'published': '2020-04-05T15:00:30', 'title': 'Open your windows ‚Äì and four other ways to improve the air quality at home', 'text': 'If you‚Äôre on lockdown, fresh air at home is vital.

Open your windows,‚Äù says Dr Appelles Econs, an allergy specialist at the Burghwood Clinic. Keeping your windows shut all day will allow chemicals and allergens to build up inside.\\n\\nEven if you live in a polluted city, you are going to have to open the windows from time to time. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to be stuck in a house with no ventilation all day,‚Äù says Dr Paul Young of Lancaster University. ‚ÄúIf you live near a super-busy road, you may not want to have the window open all the time, but you are going to need to ventilate.‚Äù Opening your windows at night, when the traffic has lessened, can be a good option.\\n\\nPlants will help, but not much\\n\\nResearch by Nasa in the 1980s found that plants do remove toxic pollutants from the air. However, these studies were carried out in closed environments, similar to conditions in space. Back on Earth, plants will improve air quality, but not as much as you may think. ‚ÄúUnless you have a rainforest in your home, the effect can be minimal,‚Äù explains Prof Pawel Wargocki of the Technical University of Denmark. ‚ÄúYou need to have many plants to see a meaningful effect on air quality because buildings are not fully airtight environments ‚Äì there is always air coming in from outside.‚Äù\\n\\nMinimise pollutants in your home\\n\\n‚ÄúWhen cooking, make sure you have your ventilator fan on,‚Äù says Young. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt smoke inside ‚Äì smoke can hang around for a long time inside.‚Äù\\n\\nConsider the products you are using to clean your home. ‚ÄúEven if their containers are firmly closed, cleaning chemicals produce volatile organic components,‚Äù says Econs. If possible, keep cleaning products outside the house, in a garden shed or garage. Econs is not a fan of air fresheners or room sprays, for the same reason.\\n\\nConsider the materials you are using\\n\\nWooden flooring, rather than carpets, may improve air quality. ‚ÄúMany fresh carpets are cured with formaldehyde,‚Äù says Econs. ‚ÄúWooden floors are more healthy by comparison.‚Äù\\n\\nDust mites can live in soft furnishings, such as cushions and mattresses. The faecal pellets they produce can trigger allergy-like symptoms. ‚ÄúGet a barrier mattress cover,‚Äù advises Econs, ‚Äúwhich can help prevent dust mites from living in your mattress.‚Äù\\n\\nBeware excess moisture\\n\\n‚ÄúThe greatest factor affecting air quality in British households is indoor humidity,‚Äù says Econs. Minimise humidity by ventilating ‚Äì and deal urgently with any mould on the walls.\\n\\n‚ÄúAfter showering, remove local moisture,‚Äù says Wargocki, by wiping down surfaces and turning on the bathroom extractor fan. And when it comes to washing clothes, try to dry them outside if possible, or at least in a well-ventilated space.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'author': ['Sirin Kale']}, {'link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/05/expectant-mothers-turn-to-freebirthing-after-home-births-cancelled', 'published': '2020-04-05T16:09:26', 'title': 'Expectant mothers turn to freebirthing after home births cancelled', 'text': 'When Victoria Gianopoulos-Johnson got a call from her midwife to say her home birth would be cancelled, panic took hold.

After exhausting those options she began researching unassisted childbirth.\\n\\n‚ÄúI found I was breathing for the first time,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI thought: OK, my mind is not there yet but my body is reacting viscerally to this.

But with the option of a home birth removed, she feels it is less risky than a hospital birth.\\n\\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm concerned about the current stress levels in hospitals, it‚Äôs not the right environment for my baby, and if I had to stay in, my partner would be unable to visit. I‚Äôm also worried about coronavirus because my son has severe asthma,‚Äù Cox says.\\n\\nLast week the charity Birthrights called for the protection of maternity rights, saying it had been inundated with concerns about the removal of home birth and birth centre options without thorough investigation.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe believe this action may be unlawful and could lead trusts to be responsible for significant risk to life if women choose to birth without medical assistance,‚Äù it said.\\n\\nThe charity said frightened women were asking about restrictions on birth partners, who in many hospitals can be present only during active labour and in a small minority of cases are banned altogether, despite strict guidelines from NHS England that birth partners should be allowed.\\n\\nThe crisis has also presented a dilemma for doulas. Daisy Dinwoodie, of the Scottish Doula Network, said: ‚ÄúTwo women have been in touch this week saying they will freebirth and asking for support. It puts me in a very difficult position because I‚Äôm not medically trained, my role is emotional support.\\n\\n‚ÄúIn the current climate I fear doulas will be blamed for women making that choice if we are present at the birth.

I made it very clear I‚Äôm not a trained medic.‚Äù\\n\\nKalusova has been present at around 10 free births but says: ‚ÄúThis is completely different. Free birth should be a planned choice but this woman feels forced into it. She says hospital is not an option due to a traumatic first birth. I‚Äôm hearing of many others in the same position.‚Äù\\n\\nSamia Ahmad, who is 32 weeks pregnant with her third child, is also opting for a free birth due to midwife shortages. She said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to have a doula because I don‚Äôt have the financial resources or the timeframe to build the necessary rapport.‚Äù\\n\\nAhmad previously lodged two complaints with the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust regarding her first birth and what she calls the ‚Äúappalling aftercare‚Äù following the unplanned unassisted birth at home of her second baby.\\n\\nShe says: ‚ÄúI feel I have no choice but to freebirth.

I‚Äôm the one not getting support for the birth I want, and I‚Äôm being backed into a corner.‚Äù\\n\\nIt is legal in the UK for a woman to freebirth and decline antenatal care. The Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services (AIMS) states: ‚ÄúA woman does not have to justify her decision, nor base it on a particular reason.‚Äù\\n\\nIts chair of trustees, Debbie Chippington Derrick, said: ‚ÄúAIMS is receiving a worrying number of calls from women asking if they can birth at home when they have been refused support from a midwife.

As the police were called, the marquess apparently told them: ‚ÄúYou sort it out, I‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù\\n\\nHe was born Alexander Thynne in London, the eldest son and second child of Henry, Viscount Weymouth, who would become the 6th Marquess of Bath, and his first wife, Daphne, the daughter of the 4th Baron Vivian.

On the 6th Marquess‚Äôs death in 1992, Alexander promptly sacked his brother and evicted him from his house on the estate. He enjoyed the publicity that came with running Longleat: ‚ÄúSometimes I leap out and pretend to be a lion!‚Äù he said in 2003. ‚Äú[Visitors] appear very pleased that they have had a chance to see me. It‚Äôs very entertaining, particularly if I talk about myself.‚Äù\\n\\nFrom the 1960s he had started decorating the house with his paintings, achieving a nobbly texture from mixing sawdust and paint and creating enormous mural-like works with titles such as Heaven and Hell (in the kitchens), Night and Day, My Early Life and, most notorious of all, a creation called Kama Sutra in a bedroom. The work showed at least 20 couples engaged in vigorous and varied sexual activities ‚Äì ‚ÄúMade ‚Äôem all up myself,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust my imagination.‚Äù The room was opened for public viewing in 1969 but was rapidly closed down by the police.\\n\\nPerhaps fortunately, the paintings were created on removable boards, but when Alexander‚Äôs son, Ceawlin, took over Longleat in 2010 and moved some of the works into storage, replacing the decor with plain white walls, his father was appalled.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my life‚Äôs work and he‚Äôs quietly binned it,‚Äù he said in 2013. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs killed my relationship with him and I don‚Äôt feel inclined to pay any interest in his wedding.‚Äù\\n\\nThat wedding, to the Anglo-Nigerian model and chef Emma McQuiston, caused ructions after the viscount‚Äôs mother, Anna, apparently questioned the dilution of ‚Äú400 years of bloodline‚Äù because of the bride‚Äôs mixed-race ancestry.\\n\\nAs a result Anna was barred from the wedding at Longleat, with security guards posted to keep her out. The marquess and his wife decamped instead to another wedding in Hampshire. Afterwards he retreated to an apartment in the upper storey of Longleat house and rarely saw, or spoke to, his son.\\n\\nHe spent many years writing his autobiography, Strictly Private, which was originally planned for 19 volumes. However, only four were issued; publishers were possibly daunted by the knowledge that he claimed to have written 6m words and had still only reached the year 1991. A novel, Pillars of the Establishment, featuring a marquess and two sons who all contracted venereal disease from the same woman, was published in the early 80s.\\n\\nThe marquess stood twice unsuccessfully for parliament in the 70s as a candidate for the Wessex Regionalists party, and sat in the Lords as a Liberal Democrat until the Labour reforms in 1999 deprived him of a seat in the upper chamber.\\n\\nHe is survived by Anna, their son, Ceawlin, who now becomes the 8th Marquess, and daughter, Lenka, and a further daughter born in 2000 whose paternity he acknowledged.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Alexander George Thynn, 7th Marquess of Bath, born 6 May 1932; died 4 April 2020', 'author': ['Stephen Bates']}, {'link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/05/claire-danes-on-the-end-of-homeland-it-was-so-nice-to-play-such-a-badass', 'published': '2020-04-05T09:00:23', 'title': \"Claire Danes on the end of Homeland: 'It was so nice to play such a badass'\", 'text': \"A landmark of 21st-century TV drama is about to finish its 10-year run. Its star reflects on how playing Carrie Mathison ‚Äì and learning from real spies ‚Äì has shaped her view of politics\\n\\nPerhaps the defining image of Homeland, one of the most ambitious US drama series of the past decade, is Claire Danes‚Äôs character, Carrie Mathison, a mercurial CIA officer, staring at a video screen and displaying a sixth sense for the vital clue. So it is fitting that Danes appears to this interviewer not in person but via FaceTime.\\n\\n‚ÄúLet me just get on to my wifi,‚Äù she says, as the signal flickers, ‚ÄúI thought I was. OK, that should be better.‚Äù\\n\\nDanes and her husband, the British actor Hugh Dancy, who have two sons ‚Äì a seven-year-old and an 18-month-old ‚Äì are weathering the coronavirus storm at a country house two hours north of New York, by far the worst-hit US city. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just kind of acclimatising to this crazy new reality where we FaceTime all the time with everybody.‚Äù\\n\\nAnd like millions of other parents, the 40-year-old actor is suddenly dealing with the challenge of home-schooling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs full-on but I‚Äôm trying to download math apps and order a bunch of workbooks and stuff from Amazon, hoping that‚Äôll keep them engaged.‚Äù\\n\\nWhen the crisis erupted and brought daily life shuddering to a standstill, Danes had been enjoying her first few days back in ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù life after a blitz of media interviews to mark the end of Homeland after eight seasons, 96 episodes and five Golden Globe awards. She had been looking forward to catching some theatre.\\n\\nIn contrast with other art forms, pre-recorded television is immune to the virus (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a resilient medium, it turns out‚Äù), and Homeland‚Äôs last bow may get a ratings boost from a captive audience. They will be witnessing the end of a landmark of 21st-century television, a drama set in the world of espionage and counterterrorism that has thrilled, surprised, frustrated, courted controversy, disappointed and returned to form, swung between sublime and ridiculous and, above all, never been less than relevant.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson and Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison in season eight of Homeland: ‚ÄòI think that‚Äôs a wonderful and surprising love story,‚Äô Danes says of their on-screen relationship. Photograph: Showtime\\n\\nIt is striking now that Homeland is often described as the first true post-9/11 drama when, in fact, it was born a full decade after the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. Perhaps events of such magnitude take that long to sink in, and we will have to wait 10 years for similarly rich drama reflecting the age of Donald Trump and the coronavirus.\\n\\nCreated by Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon of 24 fame, Homeland never had the more writerly aspirations of Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Sopranos or The Wire. But it was always contemporary, urgent, looking outward and thinking big. It captured many Americans‚Äô ambivalence about the ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù and their role in the world and showed tremendous capacity for reinvention.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little like origami,‚Äù says Danes. ‚ÄúYou just refold it and it becomes a slightly different creature. Its function was to mirror what was happening in the world and that‚Äôs ever changing, so by definition it had places to move and grow, and it was never going to suffer too badly from stagnation. My character was so wildly dynamic there was always a new facet to start to explore.‚Äù\\n\\nHomeland's function was to mirror what was happening in the world‚Ä¶ it was never going to suffer from stagnation\\n\\nAt its heart was a compelling relationship not, as first expected, between Mathison, a brilliant rule-breaker whose mind moves like jazz, and Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), a prisoner of war suspected of treason, but between Mathison and Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), who emerges as her mentor and father figure.\\n\\n‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a wonderful and surprising love story,‚Äù Danes reflects. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not one that we see depicted all that often in pop culture: mentor and mentee.‚Äù\\n\\nThe rapport with Patinkin was mirrored off screen ‚Äúkind of from the word go‚Äù, Danes says. ‚ÄúIn our first read-through the chemistry was really powerful and palpable. He looks uncannily like my best friend‚Äôs dad, who kind of raised me and is a wonderful person but, if [he] got mad at you, you felt pretty shitty. I think that helped: very strong Pavlovian response already built in! And he‚Äôs [Patinkin] just very good at what he does. Our partnership grew and deepened over time.‚Äù\\n\\nWhen Danes and Patinkin filmed their final scene together, the end of Homeland truly sank in. She recalls: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a casual scene. I think for me that was my cathartic moment when I realised it was over, because to say goodbye to it in its entirety is just too abstract and too huge. There were some tears ‚Äì many of them ‚Äì and we just hugged each other for a really long time.‚Äù\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Danes with Jared Leto in My So-Called Life, 1994. Photograph: Allstar/Studiocanal\\n\\nDanes was born in New York to artistic parents ‚Äì a photographer and painter ‚Äì and began learning modern dance when she was four years old. She was studying acting and performing on stage and screen by the age of 10, and landed her breakthrough role in My So-Called Life at 14, which took her to Los Angeles. She starred opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs 1996 Romeo + Juliet before studying for two years at Yale University.\\n\\nHer bohemian upbringing was not obvious preparation for playing a cog in the wheel of the national security apparatus and, at times, an agent of American imperialism.\\n\\n‚ÄúI grew up in downtown New York, surrounded by artists and deeply liberal folks who had a lot of scepticism about these organisations and institutions,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre suddenly playing somebody who is in that world you can‚Äôt help but be moved by their efforts. I was really struck by their patriotism, that people make profound sacrifices on behalf of our country. I took that very seriously.‚Äù\\n\\nAdapted for the US Showtime network from Gideon Raff‚Äôs Israeli series Prisoners of War, Homeland exploded into life in 2011, when water-cooler television was still a thing and a company called Netflix was working on its first original programme, House of Cards. Presumed dead, US marine sergeant Brody turns out to have been held as a prisoner of war by al-Qaida for eight years. He returns to America and a hero‚Äôs welcome. But CIA officer Mathison can see something no else does: that Brody has been turned and is now a double agent poised to attack America. She sounds the alarm but is not believed ‚Äì in part, because of her bipolar disorder. And then she and Brody have a fling.\\n\\nThe first series dazzled critics, gained fans including Barack Obama and won Emmy awards for best lead actress, lead actor, drama series and writing for drama series. Season two maintained the momentum, including an audacious, much-praised episode in which Mathison interrogates Brody at great length.\\n\\nBut in a recent Los Angeles Times interview, Gansa said ‚Äúit became much more difficult to write the show‚Äù after that episode. A subplot in which Brody again becomes a double agent was ‚Äústrained‚Äù. The series indulged twists and turns that stretched credulity, and was in danger of ‚Äújumping the shark‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhere Did Homeland Go Wrong?‚Äù demanded the New Yorker magazine.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With Damian Lewis in season one, 2011. Photograph: Moviestore/Shutterstock\\n\\nThe radical solution, apparently against Showtime‚Äôs wishes, was amputation: Brody was killed off, publicly hanged from a crane in Tehran as punishment for killing the head of Iranian intelligence, with Mathison watching in horror.\\n\\nIt was a chance for Homeland to start over. The team began attending an annual ‚Äúspy camp‚Äù at the City Tavern Club in Georgetown, Washington DC, absorbing the accumulated insights and knowledge of current and former intelligence agents, diplomatic old hands and, one year, National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden.\\n\\nSpeaking by phone, one of the participants in these brainstorming events, Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA, recalls: ‚ÄúA lot of times it was, ‚ÄòOK, what‚Äôs happening now?‚Äô We talked about that and then they talked about whichever plot they were thinking about. It was a conversation. We then went to dinner and talked about it again. It‚Äôs interesting, because the more we did it, the more they had our kind of questions.‚Äù\\n\\nAmerica‚Äôs response to 9/11 was not great. We didn‚Äôt identify the real source of conflict and we were too reactionary\\n\\nDanes has fond memories of the spy camps. ‚ÄúThe days were long and dense,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd meet at nine and the revolving door was in constant motion, depositing one story and then another, and they were often told by people who had very different ideologies and political positions. It was a huge privilege because you really did get to look into a crystal ball from all these amazing sources and get a fairly clear picture of what our reality might be like in a year‚Äôs time.‚Äù\\n\\nWere there any surprises? ‚ÄúWhen we first started the show, I didn‚Äôt realise that Russians were a potentially difficult relationship. I thought we had worked through that! It‚Äôs also just a shock that these people actually exist. I was interested in how that would inform a person‚Äôs emotional makeup or their intimate relationships. You hear stories of people working [together] in really volatile posts for years on end and then they come home and separate: the adrenaline is gone. What it is to be so isolated, to carry all of those secrets, be shape-shifting, assuming different identities‚Ä¶‚Äù\\n\\nThis brains trust helped Homeland take a new, more self-questioning direction. The first episode of season four was entitled ‚ÄúThe Drone Queen‚Äù, with Mathison in Kabul, Afghanistan, as the CIA‚Äôs youngest ever station chief. She gives the go-ahead for a military strike on a wedding in Pakistan, killing dozens of innocent civilians.\\n\\nSeason five shifted to Berlin, with Mathison having quit the CIA to work for a German billionaire philanthropist who, at one point, upbraids Berenson: ‚ÄúNothing has made the world more dangerous than the foreign policy of the United States.‚Äù The series also kept bumping up against real events. The crew was filming in Berlin just after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris.\\n\\nSeason six (early 2017) was even more spookily prescient on themes of fake news, Russian election interference and a president-elect at loggerheads with the intelligence community. It premiered five days before the inauguration of Trump, whose bellicose attacks on the FBI, CIA and so-called ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù appalled Danes.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe worked with the intelligence community over the years, and I‚Äôve been playing somebody within it. It was hard not to feel real empathy and deep appreciation and loyalty. So when suddenly they were dismissed and undermined by a president, it was just so hard to believe.‚Äù\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest F Murray Abraham and Maury Sterling in Homeland season six, which predicted Russian election interference. Photograph: 20th Century Fox/JoJo Whilden/Showtime\\n\\nThe final season has again given a voice to outside critics of American adventurism abroad, and again mirrored real events, this time with a president winding down the country‚Äôs longest war, in Afghanistan. While there, Mathison is confronted by multiple gravestones bearing the same date of death, the consequence of her own past actions. And she comes full circle to find herself in Brody‚Äôs shoes, under suspicion for possibly having been turned by a foreign adversary.\\n\\nHomeland‚Äôs politics remains complex and problematic. Some argue that, in the later years, it sought redemption. Did Danes observe a conscious tilt to the left? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we were editorialising too much,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI think we were really just charting that curve. Our [America‚Äôs] response to 9/11 was not great. We didn‚Äôt identify the real source of danger and conflict and we were too reactionary and we betrayed a lot of our values because of the panic we were in.\\n\\n‚ÄúSo we kind of learned that as we went along. When I was talking to Alex [Gansa] about the final season, he framed it in a way that was helpful. He said when we first started telling our story, it was directly to do with our response to 9/11, and nearly a decade later we‚Äôre wondering if we‚Äôve in fact learned anything, if we would react differently.\\n\\n‚ÄúHe simulated an event that would sort of be comparable in scale, as traumatising and as consequential, which is the president‚Äôs helicopter going down. That was a litmus test. How do our characters in this story interpret that? Do they pause and judiciously consider their next move or do they go straight into offensive mode, a fear-based mode?‚Äù\\n\\nOne of the most enduring criticisms of the series is its portrayal of Muslims. Under the headline ‚ÄúHomeland is the most bigoted show on television‚Äù, writer and film-maker Laura Durkay wrote in the Washington Post in 2014: ‚ÄúSince its first episode, Homeland has churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the cliche.‚Äù\\n\\nThe following year, Arab graffiti artists who had been hired by the producers to add realism to the set of Syrian refugee camp wrote: ‚ÄúHomeland is racist.‚Äù No one noticed and translated it until the episode was broadcast. It was, one comedian observed, a major intelligence failure. Danes acknowledges: ‚ÄúThat was a good stunt. All of our hats were off to them.‚Äù\\n\\nOn the broader issue, she says: ‚ÄúI get it. I think it‚Äôs tricky and kind of inherently problematic, right? There are a lot of brown people in our story who are doing really bad things, and there aren‚Äôt enough opportunities to create a more balanced portrait of that demographic. That was always going to be a point of vulnerability for us, but I also think that our heroes are really problematic and really flawed. We‚Äôre wrestling with some pretty challenging questions and ideas and those two sides of various arguments were personified by our characters.\\n\\n‚ÄúIn most cases I think both characters were right. Our writers were fairly responsible about that, creating a real debate. In the first episode of this season we have the Palestinian politician who‚Äôs really challenging Saul and making credible, cogent points about the ways that America has failed. I was happy about that at least.‚Äù\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Danes in the final season of Homeland. Photograph: Sifeddine Elamine/Showtime\\n\\nAnother sensitive area has been Homeland‚Äôs portrayal of bipolar disorder. But Danes received positive feedback from people with the disorder. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been mostly appreciative, which I feel great relief about and gratitude for. That condition is not dramatised all that often so I think any conversation that‚Äôs stimulated by it is welcome. I never wanted her being bipolar to be a gimmick or just a convenient plot device, and I tried to be as specific and informed as possible. It‚Äôs a really fascinating human condition. I developed such respect for people who work as diligently as they do to just make it through a day.‚Äù\\n\\nActors sometimes talk about taking a while to shake off their last part, as if the character lingers like a ghost. Will Danes, who is now thinking about originating her own material, miss Carrie Mathison? ‚ÄúOh my gosh, so much,‚Äù she says via the FaceTime link, where there will be no farewell handshake. ‚ÄúI loved her. It was just so nice to play the smartest person in the room, somebody who was so daring and unapologetically ambitious and such a badass. She‚Äôs not really going away.‚Äù\\n\\nHomeland season eight screens on Channel 4 at 9pm (UK) and at 9pm on Showtime in the US.

His work is contentious, he says, because it calls into question the superiority of humans\\n\\nI had hoped to interview the plant neurobiologist Stefano Mancuso at his laboratory at the University of Florence. I picture it as a botanical utopia: a place where flora is respected for its awareness and intelligence; where sensitive mimosa plants can demonstrate their long memories; and where humans are invited to learn how to be a better species by observing the behaviour of our verdant fellow organisms.\\n\\nBut because we are both on lockdown, we Skype from our homes.

At the time, it was ‚Äúalmost forbidden‚Äù to talk about behaviour in plants. But ‚Äúwe study how plants are able to solve problems, how they memorise, how they communicate, how they have their social life and things like that‚Äù.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Flower power ... Mancuso‚Äôs team has shown that Mimosa pudica can retain learned information for weeks. Photograph: Alamy\\n\\nMancuso and his colleagues have become experts in training plants, just like neuroscientists train lab rats. If you let a drop of water fall on a Mimosa pudica, its kneejerk response is to recoil its leaves, but, if you continue doing so, the plant will quickly cotton on that the water is harmless and stop reacting. The plants can hold on to this knowledge for weeks, even when their living conditions, such as lighting, are changed. ‚ÄúThat was unexpected because we were thinking about very short memories, in the range of one or two days ‚Äì the average memory of insects,‚Äù says Mancuso. ‚ÄúTo find that plants were able to memorise for two months was a surprise.‚Äù Not least because they don‚Äôt have brains.\\n\\nIn a plant, a single brain would be a fatal flaw because they have evolved to be lunch. ‚ÄúPlants use a very different strategy,‚Äù says Mancuso. ‚ÄúThey are very good at diffusing the same function all over the body.‚Äù You can remove 90% of a plant without killing it. ‚ÄúYou need to imagine a plant as a huge brain. Maybe not as efficient as in the case of animals, but diffused everywhere.‚Äù\\n\\nOne of the most controversial aspects of Mancuso‚Äôs work is the idea of plant consciousness. As we learn more about animal and plant intelligence, not to mention human intelligence, the always-contentious term consciousness has become the subject of ever more heated scientific and philosophical debate. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs use another term,‚Äù Mancuso suggests. ‚ÄúConsciousness is a little bit tricky in both our languages. Let‚Äôs talk about awareness. Plants are perfectly aware of themselves.‚Äù A simple example is when one plant overshadows another ‚Äì the shaded plant will grow faster to reach the light. But when you look into the crown of a tree, all the shoots are heavily shaded. They do not grow fast because they know that they are shaded by part of themselves. ‚ÄúSo they have a perfect image of themselves and of the outside,‚Äù says Mancuso.\\n\\nWhen corn is nibbled by caterpillars, the plant emits a distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate them\\n\\nScience struggles to view plants as active and motivated because its outlook is so humancentric, he argues. One test for self-awareness in animals is whether they can look in a mirror and understand that they are looking at themselves. ‚ÄúVery few animals are able to do this,‚Äù says Mancuso. ‚ÄúHumans, dolphins, a few apes and probably elephants. This has been taken in recent years as a kind of evidence that just these few groups of animals have self-awareness.‚Äù Mancuso believes this is wrong. ‚ÄúMy personal opinion is that there is no life that is not aware of itself. For me, it‚Äôs impossible to imagine any form of life that is not able to be intelligent, to solve problems.‚Äù\\n\\nAnother misconception is that plants are the definition of a vegetative state ‚Äì incommunicative and insensitive to what is around them. But Mancuso says plants are far more sensitive than animals. ‚ÄúAnd this is not an opinion. This is based on thousands of pieces of evidence. We know that a single root apex is able to detect at least 20 different chemical and physical parameters, many of which we are blind to.‚Äù There could be a tonne of cobalt or nickel under our feet, and we would have no idea, whereas ‚Äúplants can sense a few milligrams in a huge amount of soil‚Äù, he says.\\n\\nFar from being silent and passive, plants are social and communicative, above ground and beneath, through their roots and fungal networks. They are adept at detecting subtle electromagnetic fields generated by other life forms. They use chemicals and scents to warn each other of danger, deter predators and attract pollinating insects. When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, for example, the plant emits a chemical distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate the caterpillars.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A slower pace of life ... Old Tjikko in Sweden is almost 10,000 years old. Photograph: Lars Johansson/Getty Images/iStockphoto\\n\\nPlants respond to sound, too, ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù vibrations all over. ‚ÄúPlants are extremely good at detecting specific kinds of sounds, for example at 200hz or 300hz ‚Ä¶ because they are seeking the sound of running water.‚Äù If you put a source of 200hz sound close to the roots of a plant, he says, they will follow it. There is no evidence that the human voice benefits plants, although talking to plants may soothe the humans doing it.\\n\\nAnother reason we overlook plants‚Äô intelligence is their vastly slower pace of life. In Mancuso‚Äôs new book, The Incredible Journey of Plants, we meet the world‚Äôs oldest plant ‚Äì Old Tjikko ‚Äì a red fir tree whose roots have writhed in the Swedish earth for about 9,560 years. We are also introduced to the ingenious seeds of crimson fountain grass, which choose not to germinate until the conditions are perfect ‚Äì and can survive for six years while waiting.\\n\\nThe main thrust of the book is that plants were the original pioneers and have been forever exploring the planet. Mancuso eschews the notion of ‚Äúnative species‚Äù and prizes so-called invasive species above all else. ‚ÄúThe more invasive they are, the more I like them, because they are the most brilliant example of the ability to solve problems,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúInvasive species are the most beautiful plants that I can imagine.‚Äù For Mancuso, ‚Äúmigration is one of the most important forces of nature. All living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural.‚Äù\\n\\nAlthough new generations of botanists are increasingly embracing plant neurobiology, Mancuso still has his detractors. Last summer, a group of eight plant scientists wrote in the journal Trends in Plant Science that Mancuso and his colleagues ‚Äúhave consistently glossed over the unique and remarkable degree of structural, organisational and functional complexity that the animal brain had to evolve before consciousness could emerge‚Äù. Mancuso says that almost all of these botanists are retired. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an older generation of plant scientists that is completely against any notion of a plant as intelligent or behaving. For them, plants are kind of a semi-living organic machine.‚Äù\\n\\nAll living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural\\n\\nThe notion that humans are the apex of life on Earth is one of the most dangerous ideas around, says Mancuso: ‚ÄúWhen you feel yourself better than all the other humans or other living organisms, you start to use them. This is exactly what we‚Äôve been doing. We felt ourselves as outside nature.‚Äù The average lifespan of a species on Earth is between 2m and 5m years. ‚ÄúHomo sapiens have lived just 300,000 years,‚Äù he says ‚Äì and already ‚Äúwe have been able to almost destroy our environment. From this point of view, how can we say that we are better organisms?‚Äù\\n\\nPerhaps we should try ‚Äì ahem ‚Äì taking a leaf out of the plant kingdom‚Äôs book. Human societies and organisations are structured like our bodies ‚Äì with a brain, or a top-level control centre, and various different organs governing specific functions. ‚ÄúWe use this in our universities, our companies, even our class divisions,‚Äù says Mancuso. This structure enables us to move fast, physically and organisationally, but it also leaves us vulnerable. If a major organ fails, it could scupper everything, and top-down leadership rarely serves the whole.\\n\\nPlants, by contrast, ‚Äúare kind of horizontal, diffusive, decentralised organisations that are much more in line with modernity‚Äù. Take the internet, the ultimate decentralised root system. ‚ÄúLook at the ability of Wikipedia to produce a wonderful amount of good-quality information by using a decentralised, diffused organisation. I‚Äôm claiming that, by studying plant networks, we can find wonderful solutions for us,‚Äù Or take the ethos of cooperation. Plants, say Mancuso, ‚Äúare masters of starting symbiotic relationships with other organisms: bacteria, mushrooms, insects, even us. Just look at the way they use us to be transported all around the world.‚Äù We may think we have the upper hand, but plants may beg to differ.\\n\\nThe Incredible Journey of Plants by Stefano Mancuso is published by Penguin Random House USA', 'author': ['Amy Fleming']}, {'link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/03/the-devastating-impact-of-covid-19-in-new-york-podcast', 'published': '2020-04-03T02:00:06', 'title': 'The devastating impact of Covid-19 in New York ‚Äì podcast', 'text': 'The Guardian US health reporter Jessica Glenza reports from New York, where medical facilities and staff are being overwhelmed by the Covid-19 outbreak\\n\\nNew York City is a densely populated city that welcomes millions of visitors every month ‚Äì which in part explains why it‚Äôs been hit so hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.

But societies do. And in so doing, they ensure that the devastation wreaked by the virus is not equally shared.\\n\\nWe can see this in the way that the low paid both disproportionately have to continue to work and are more likely to be laid off; in the sacking of an Amazon worker for leading a protest against unsafe conditions; in the rich having access to coronavirus tests denied to even most NHS workers.\\n\\nBut to see most clearly how societies allow the virus to discriminate, look not at London or Rome or New York but at Delhi and Johannesburg and Lagos. Here, ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù means something very different than it does to Europeans or Americans. It is less about the physical space between people than the social space between the rich and poor that means only the privileged can maintain any kind of social isolation.\\n\\nIn the Johannesburg township of Alexandra, somewhere between 180,000 and 750,000 people live in an estimated 20,000 shacks. Through it runs South Africa‚Äôs most polluted river, the Jukskei, whose water has tested positive for cholera and has run black from sewage. Makoko is often called Lagos‚Äôs ‚Äúfloating slum‚Äù because a third of the shacks are built on stilts over a fetid lagoon. No one is sure how many people live there, but it could be up to 300,000. Dharavi, in Mumbai, is the word‚Äôs largest slum. Like Makoko and Alexandra, it nestles next to fabulously rich areas, but the million people estimated to live there are squashed into less than a square mile of land that was once a rubbish tip.\\n\\nIn such neighbourhoods, what can social distancing mean? Extended families often live in one- or two-room shacks. The houses may be scrubbed and well kept but many don‚Äôt have lavatories, electricity or running water. Communal latrines and water points are often shared by thousands. Diseases from diarrhoea to typhoid stalked such neighbourhoods well before coronavirus.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People in their shanties at Dharavi during the coronavirus lockdown in Mumbai. Photograph: Rajanish Kakade/AP\\n\\nSouth Africa, Nigeria and India have all imposed lockdowns. Alexandra and Dharavi have both reported their first cases of coronavirus. But in these neighbourhoods, the idea of protecting oneself from coronavirus must seem as miraculous as clean water.\\n\\nLast week, tens of thousands of Indian workers, suddenly deprived of the possibility of pay, and with most public transport having been shut down, decided to walk back to their home villages, often hundreds of miles away, in the greatest mass exodus since partition. Four out of five Indians work in the informal sector. Almost 140 million, more than a quarter of India‚Äôs working population, are migrants from elsewhere in the country. Yet their needs had barely figured in the thinking of policymakers, who seemed shocked by the actions of the workers.\\n\\nIndia‚Äôs great exodus shows that ‚Äúmigration‚Äù is not, as we imagine in the west, merely external migration, but internal migration, too. Internal migrants, whether in India, Nigeria or South Africa, are often treated as poorly as external ones and often for the same reason ‚Äì they are not seen as ‚Äúone of us‚Äù and so denied basic rights and dignities. In one particularly shocking incident, hundreds of migrants returning to the town of Bareilly, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, were sprayed by officials with chemicals usually used to sanitise buses. They might as well have been vermin, not just metaphorically but physically, too.\\n\\nAll this should make us think harder about what we mean by ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù. In Britain, the pandemic has led to a flowering of social-mindedness and community solidarity. Where I live in south London, a mutual aid group has sprung up to help self-isolating older people. The food bank has gained a new throng of volunteers. Such welcome developments have been replicated in hundreds of places around the country.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest South African National Defence Force soldiers enforce lockdown in Johannesburg‚Äôs Alexandra township on 28 March 2020. Photograph: Luca Sola/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nBut the idea of a community is neither as straightforward nor as straightforwardly good as we might imagine. When Donald Trump reportedly offers billions of dollars to a German company to create a vaccine to be used exclusively for Americans, when Germany blocks the export of medical equipment to Italy, when Britain, unlike Portugal, refuses to extend to asylum seekers the right to access benefits and healthcare during the coronavirus crisis, each does so in the name of protecting a particular community or nation.\\n\\nThe rhetoric of community and nation can become a means not just to discount those deemed not to belong but also to obscure divisions within. In India, Narendra Modi‚Äôs BJP government constantly plays to nationalist themes, eulogising Mother India, or BhƒÅrat Mata. But it‚Äôs a nationalism that excludes many groups, from Muslims to the poor. In Dharavi and Alexandra and Makoko, and many similar places, it will not simply be coronavirus but also the willingness of the rich, both in poor countries and in wealthier nations, to ignore gross inequalities that will kill.\\n\\nIn Britain in recent weeks, there has been a welcome, belated recognition of the importance of low-paid workers. Yet in the decade before that, their needs were sacrificed to the demands of austerity, under the mantra of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all in it together‚Äù. We need to beware of the same happening after the pandemic, too, of the rhetoric of community and nation being deployed to protect the interests of privileged groups. We need to beware, too, that in a world that many insist will be more nationalist, and less global, we don‚Äôt simply ignore what exists in places such as Alexandra and Makoko and Dharavi.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all at risk from the virus,‚Äù observed Gove. That‚Äôs true. It is also true that societies, both nationally and globally, are structured in ways that ensure that some face far more risk than others ‚Äì and not just from coronavirus.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist', 'author': ['Kenan Malik']}, {'link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/i-cant-wait-for-the-school-holidays-i-can-finally-stop-doing-my-kids-homework', 'published': '2020-04-05T14:00:29', 'title': \"I can't wait for the school holidays.

Damn right, this is an important distinction.\\n\\nI have solicited expert views on how to homeschool. I have also waxed philosophical about whether or not this is a good time to set your family free from the constraints of formal education and teach them other stuff instead, our own special skills such as how to make Korean-style whipped iced coffee (which they are brilliant at) or how to find something in a drawer. But my lived reality is neither of these things. Instead, it‚Äôs an unedifying cycle, where I badger them to at least get their homework out, hassle them into telling me what it is, and then end up doing it for them.\\n\\nThe 10-year-old had to write a letter to Boris Johnson, telling him how coronavirus made her feel. She found this inherently droll, given that he actually had it. Like, you would never do that with any other disease. ‚ÄúDear person with tuberculosis, I want to tell you a little bit about how tuberculosis, which I don‚Äôt have, makes me feel.‚Äù\\n\\nI said: ‚ÄúGive them a break, they might have set this before he was diagnosed.

That‚Äôs more of a postcard.‚Äù This is my special skill, making things longer. This is the work I was born to do. I could do a paragraph wishing him well, and asking about his symptoms. I could tell him about the pets in the household. Frankly, I was on fire, we had a serviceable letter in 10 minutes flat and the only problem was that I‚Äôd written it.\\n\\nNext she had to analyse a piece of graffiti: ‚ÄúThe people save the people / NHS staff, you are our pride.‚Äù What did she think it meant? What slogan would she spray paint on to a wall to show her appreciation for the NHS?\\n\\n‚ÄúThanks?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúThink you‚Äôd have to be a bit more specific, like: ‚ÄòDoctors, thanks!‚Äô‚Äù We agreed that nurses shouldn‚Äôt be left out. Then, that we would need some way to get their attention, and landed on: ‚ÄúOi, nurses and doctors, thanks!‚Äù If I had just butted out, and it had been that lame, it would have been fine. But I had basically done it, and it was still that lame.\\n\\nThen I went to harass the 12-year-old, who was answering questions about a speech in Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream, which he claimed not to understand one word of. Oberon had just ‚Äúforgiven‚Äù Titania ‚Äì why had I put forgiveness in inverted commas, he wanted to know? Well, because it‚Äôs pretty gaslighty, drugging someone to fall in love, then being enraged by their infidelity. So I would call forgiveness quite a moot concept.\\n\\nIt turned out feminist revisionism was definitely not what he wanted. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù I asked.\\n\\n‚ÄúBECAUSE THAT‚ÄôS NOT WHAT THEY‚ÄôVE ASKED FOR. LITERALLY NOWHERE ON THIS SHEET DOES IT SAY: ‚ÄòWHAT WOULD A FEMINIST THINK OF OBERON?‚Äô.‚Äù The question, rather, was: ‚ÄúWhat do Oberon and Titania do next?‚Äù, relating to the line: ‚ÄúSound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me / And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI guess it could mean dancing, given the music. Or it could mean having sex.

I remember feeling sick when I first read an ITV report detailing these incidents at the end of last year. And it was at the front of my mind as I whooped in support of our carers on Thursday night.\\n\\nI returned to that report last week after posting what I thought was an uncontroversial tweet, noting the fact that all four doctors who had tragically lost their lives to coronavirus at that point were people of colour, and that it was a reminder of how much the NHS relies on BAME and migrant doctors and nurses. Just over four in 10 NHS medical staff are BAME, and almost one in three doctors are not from the UK. From the first Caribbean nurses who arrived after the second world war, the NHS has been built on the backs of both migrant and British workers; in the late 1960s, half of all doctors below consultant level were non-British.\\n\\nSo I was surprised when a prominent broadcaster weighed in to lecture me on the irrelevance of my comment, then simply ignored efforts made to highlight to her the racism experienced by some NHS staff in the line of duty. And I was left pretty shaken by the 48-hour deluge of racist diatribe that ensued, a chunk of which came from her fans and followers.\\n\\nIt was an effective, if painful, reminder of how racism manifests itself: not just in words such as ‚ÄúPaki‚Äù but in the self-appointed white gatekeepers who see it as their business to police celebrations of the contributions made, sometimes in the face of appalling racism, by people of colour. I‚Äôve lost count of the number of times I‚Äôve been called a racist simply for acknowledging the ethnicity of the medical professionals who gave their lives to keep us safe.\\n\\nThese anti-immigrant signalling devices are more reflective of a nastiness at the heart of government than society\\n\\nSo it‚Äôs worth reiterating why the skin colour of our fallen NHS heroes matters. It‚Äôs not just that outright racism and rising levels of Islamophobia affect the wellbeing of NHS workers willingly risking their lives to keep us all safe, it is that, as the General Medical Council has acknowledged, BAME medics face structural racism. And the government‚Äôs anti-immigration rhetoric continues to legitimise discrimination at the frontline.\\n\\nWhile I was happy to hear health secretary Matt Hancock paying particular thanks to the migrant NHS workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus, years of racist government policy give his words a hollow ring. The 81-year-old Windrush nurse kept out of the UK and separated from her children and grandchildren for nine years after taking a holiday to Jamaica; the ‚Äúright to rent‚Äù policy that requires landlords to perform immigrant status checks that the high court has now ruled racially discriminatory; the punitive NHS levy ‚Äì ¬£2,200 a year for a family of four ‚Äì that all migrants, including NHS staff, have to pay on top of the taxes they contribute which already more than cover on average their use of public services.\\n\\nWhat‚Äôs heartening is that these anti-immigrant signalling devices are more reflective of a nastiness at the heart of government than they are of society in general. There are far fewer people today whose hostility to immigration is driven by racism than there were 10 years ago; rising levels of hate crime are more likely to be a product of racists feeling newly emboldened and legitimised than a significant swelling of their ranks. I hope Hancock‚Äôs welcome shift in tone will be matched by a shift in policy: an offer of citizenship to migrant health and care workers in recognition of their extraordinary contribution.\\n\\nBut while racism still exists, it will always remain vital to pay special tribute to the contributions of people of colour. I would encourage my critics to watch this video made last year where surgeon Radhakrishna Shanbag describes how it feels to be asked, ‚Äúcan I have a white doctor to do the operation?‚Äù and reflect on why those tributes feel so triggering.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the bullies and gatekeepers will never silence me from saying this: Amged el-Hawrani, Adil El Tayar, Areema Nasreen, Alfa Saadu, Habib Zaidi, you are all heroes, and your sacrifice will not be forgotten.

Telling the public what they want to hear is suddenly out of fashion in partisan journalism. Instead, they are telling them what they need to hear. In public health, communication is everything. Policy and behavioural change is the target with Covid-19 and government accountability is the key.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the US, the unthinkable happened as Fox News, which rallied behind Donald Trump in the earliest days of his coronavirus denial, sharply changed its tune. It fired Trish Regan, a host on Fox Business, after a histrionic opening monologue to her show where she blamed ‚Äúliberal media‚Äù for spreading ‚Äúmass hysteria‚Äù and using the coronavirus as a tool for impeachment.\\n\\nSean Hannity, the most high profile and Trump-aligned Fox personality, dropped the ‚ÄúCoronavirus hysteria‚Äù graphic from 9 March and replaced it with a more sombre ‚ÄúFacts over fear‚Äù tone a week later. It might be too late. A survey from the Pew Research Center‚Äôs Journalism and Media Project last week showed a stark division in beliefs about the spread of the virus, according to which cable outlet viewers watched.\\n\\nIn a world where facts have been treated as optional, particularly by Fox News‚Äôs main channel, the need for a shared belief in evidence-based coverage has now become a matter of life and death. An open letter from journalists and academics was sent to Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch, and his son and Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch, detailing the ways in which the deliberate spread of misinformation on the channel was endangering lives: ‚ÄúInexcusably, Fox News has violated elementary canons of journalism. In so doing, it has contributed to the spread of a grave pandemic.‚Äù\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of the more comfortable practices of government press relations, on both sides of the Atlantic, have also been put under the microscope. In the UK, the briefing of lobby correspondents on complex health issues is clearly not working. While it is important to know how the government is thinking and forming its strategy, it is also important that subject experts can ask the harder follow-up questions. Off-the-record briefings to favoured journalists, particularly those with a large broadcast presence, have long been standard practice. But there is something shockingly irresponsible about ideas such as the disastrous ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù strategy being laundered through a journalist, even one as well respected as ITV‚Äôs Robert Peston.\\n\\nThose with long memories will remember what a tour de force Peston was as a BBC journalist, breaking story after story on the financial collapse in 2008. As a highly skilled and experienced financial journalist, he was in the perfect position to understand and interrogate the information.\\n\\n\\n\\nTen days ago, the US press was debating why it sends political journalists to the White House daily press briefings, rather than health correspondents. Now a number of high-profile outlets, including the Washington Post and the New York Times, are simply not sending correspondents to the briefings at all, as editors judge the news-free pantomime of a miniature Trump rally not worth the risk to reporters‚Äô health.\\n\\nCable and broadcast networks no longer, as a matter of course, carry the full two-hour rambling promotions. On a good day the medical expertise of Dr Anthony Fauci or Dr Deborah Birx comes to the fore, obscuring the boastful rambling of the president. On a bad day, you might get the Trump cheerleader and chief executive of MyPillow, Michael J Lindell, or Jared Kushner, the president‚Äôs ineffectual son-in-law.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot everything is worse than expected. If you had told New Yorkers, before the wave of a deadly pandemic broke over them, that the national hero of the catastrophe would be their governor, Andrew Cuomo, and his somewhat notorious powerpoint presentations, few would have believed it. Cuomo‚Äôs peacetime reputation as a political blunt instrument, whose policies have neither addressed inequality or fixed the subway, has been blown away by a wartime leader of gravity and directness, warmth and steel.\\n\\nCuomo is Churchillian, in that his decidedly poor record on many peacetime political matters has been largely erased by getting the wartime calls right. Cuomo‚Äôs daily walk through the unvarnished numbers of New York City deaths, hospitalisations, availability of beds and ventilators, the expansion of emergency facilities, is nationally required viewing. The clarity of now, is reassuring in the grip of future uncertainty.\\n\\nReliable clear information, presented in a clear understandable way, peppered with human empathy, goes a long way to papering over the yawning chasms of unpreparedness.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are by now used to thinking ahead about what might change after the pandemic is tamed.

Not what Liverpool are doing, that's for sure\", 'text': 'Six months ago the Liverpool chief executive, Peter Moore, was asked what distinguished his club from other European football giants. ‚ÄúWe had this amazing historical figure: Bill Shankly, a Scottish socialist who built the foundation,‚Äù he told El Pais. ‚ÄúEven today, when we talk about business, we ask ourselves: ‚ÄòWhat would Shankly do?‚Äô‚Äù\\n\\nLiverpool challenged by Spirit of Shankly fan group over staff furlough Read more\\n\\nSo what would Shankly do in a global pandemic that threatens to bring the economy and the health system to its knees? The answer, it‚Äôs safe to say, would not involve piggybacking on a government scheme to stop mass unemployment when you are the world‚Äôs seventh-richest club. Furloughing Liverpool‚Äôs non-playing staff ‚Äì saving perhaps ¬£1m ‚Äì when you have an annual wage bill of ¬£310m and paid ¬£43m to agents last year is not a good look.\\n\\nTrue, Newcastle and Spurs did the same last week but by now we know who Mike Ashley and Daniel Levy are. Liverpool were supposed to be different.\\n\\nYet at a stroke the club‚Äôs owner undermined the work of their captain, Jordan Henderson, the driving force behind plans to arrange a Premier League fund for NHS staff. It‚Äôs not too late for Fenway Sports Group to admit it has misjudged the public mood, to row back, to apologise. Even the smartest people get it wrong sometimes.\\n\\nHowever, Liverpool‚Äôs problems merely reflect the trouble English football has in responding to these dislocating times. You cannot blame players who are being asked to give up ‚Äì or defer ‚Äì 30% of their salaries for being aggrieved when they don‚Äôt know whether the money will go towards the NHS or back into their owners‚Äô pockets.\\n\\nIt is also a bit rich for the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to publicly shame footballers when frontline medical staff are lethally short of PPE equipment. And, let‚Äôs be honest, if the government really wanted the super-rich to contribute more in this crisis, there is an easy solution: change the tax system.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jordan Henderson has contacted his fellow Premier League captains to organise a coronavirus fund that will raise millions of pounds for the NHS Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images\\n\\nThat said it was obvious football might get a kicking weeks ago and the players, the Professional Footballers‚Äô Association and the Premier League should have anticipated it. In mid-March, donating a large sum to the NHS would have been a massive PR win. Now it looks like they are being shamed into it, while also appearing out of touch with fans.\\n\\nThere are some who will say the game is less connected to local communities nowadays ‚Äì after all, top players make more money in a week than most of us earn in a year. But the evidence suggests otherwise. Spanish academics have twice studied how much Deportivo La Coru√±a mattered to the people of La Coru√±a, first in 2003 and then again in 2012. ‚ÄúOne of the most striking data,‚Äù they wrote in their latter study, ‚Äúis the increase in the percentage of people who believe that if Deportivo disappeared, the quality of life in the city would be worse.‚Äù\\n\\nLiverpool under fire for furloughs while PFA points to pay-cut tax trap Read more\\n\\nSimilar results have been found in England. A 2015 study asked just under 1,200 residents in Luton and Bury how important their club was to the town. A total of 47% in Luton and 39% in Bury felt their quality of life would reduce if their football club was no longer around.\\n\\nBury are already on the brink and last week two chief executives in sport told me they are working on the assumption things won‚Äôt get back to where they were until September. How many other Football League and National League clubs might be in trouble by then? And how healthy will other organisations, such as UK Athletics or the British Basketball League, be if no events take place by then?\\n\\nCertainly with the economy forecast to take the biggest gut-punch since the Great Depression it is hard to see a swift return to normalcy. Already there are predictions the business model that has supercharged the Premier League and other sports will change, with the value of broadcasting rights likely to fall.\\n\\nHow will it not, if fewer of us can afford pay-TV? Over the coming months football would do well to learn from other sports, who have shown it is possible to work speedily and effectively for the greater good. Three weeks ago the Professional Triathletes Organisation announced it would increase its annual end-of-year bonus scheme from $2m to $2.5m ‚Äì and immediately paid it out rather than wait until December.\\n\\nFootball Weekly Philippe Auclair on Fifa, Cantona and board games ‚Äì Football Weekly Extra Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/02-57075-gnl.fw.200402.jf.PhilippeAuclair.mp3 00:00:00 00:49:49\\n\\nRealising that triathletes lower down the food chain would need extra help, it gave the extra $500,000 in bonuses just to men and women ranked between 21 and 100 in the world. The world‚Äôs top 10 have also committed to doing online appearances and exhibitions and donating all the revenue to lower-ranked triathletes.\\n\\nOther bodies, such as Sport England, are also stepping up. Last week it announced a ¬£192m package to help grassroots sport ‚Äì including a ¬£20m emergency fund with grants of between ¬£300 and ¬£10,000 for sports clubs and community organisations, those vital but unappreciated capillaries in our society. That comes down to smart leadership.

Gretchen Whitmer must send an unequivocal message to her constituents that Michigan is her priority in this hour of crisis,‚Äù the editorial, which was published on Saturday, said. ‚ÄúHer running feud with President Donald Trump calls into question whether she\\'s acting in the best interests of this state, or on behalf of the Democratic Party.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúUnfortunately she\\'s sending conflicting signals about her priorities and motivations,‚Äù the article continued.\\n\\nWhitmer, like her counterparts in other states, has seen her profile rise in recent weeks as the nation‚Äôs leaders coordinate response efforts to the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nMichigan, and in particular the Detroit metropolitan area, has quickly become a hotspot for the virus. As of Sunday, Michigan was reporting the third most coronavirus cases with 14,225, following New Jersey and New York with 34,124 and 114,174 respectively, according to data compiled by Fox News. Michigan reported the third most deaths in the country with 540, according to the data.\\n\\nWhitmer, who ran for governor as a pragmatic liberal, emphasizing her bipartisanship while pledging to fix Michigan‚Äôs crumbling roads, rarely talked about Trump before the election or after. But as a frequent guest on national media in recent weeks, Whitmer has criticized the federal response while pleading for ventilators, personal protection equipment and test kits.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe have no criticism of how Whitmer is handling this crisis; she is taking the same steps as most other governors in states hard hit by the virus,‚Äù the editorial read. ‚ÄúBut she\\'s also assumed the role of designated Democratic attack dog in this crisis, appearing almost daily on cable news shows to criticize the administration\\'s handling of the virus response. That creates confusion about whether Whitmer is advocating for her Michigan constituents, or carrying out her duties as co-chair of Joe Biden\\'s presidential campaign, or worse, serving her own ambition to be vice president.‚Äù\\n\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden confirmed last week that he is considering Whitmer, a rising star in the Democratic Party, as a potential running mate in his White House bid.\\n\\nRepublicans were especially upset after she implied during a Friday radio interview that the Trump administration was intentionally withholding medical supplies from Michigan.\\n\\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW\\n\\nLast weekend, Trump called her ‚ÄúGretchen ‚ÄòHalf‚Äô Whitmer,‚Äù charging that she was in ‚Äúway over her head‚Äù and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have a clue‚Äù about how to handle the health crisis. Two days earlier, Trump said he had instructed Vice President Mike Pence, the leader of the White House pandemic response, not to call ‚Äúthe woman in Michigan.‚Äù The editorial brought up the fact that Trump had reportedly called Whitmer ‚Äúthe woman from Michigan.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúShe responded by showing up on a late night talk show wearing a t-shirt bearing those words while disingenuously declaring that this is no time to play politics,‚Äù the editorial read. ‚ÄúIt certainly isn\\'t. It\\'s also no time to engage in a silly tit-for-tat with the president.‚Äù\\n\\nTrump has since deleted the tweet. In a Tuesday press briefing, he said he had a productive conversation with Whitmer earlier in the day. Whitmer has also backed away from feuding with the president as the state grapples with the escalating crisis.\\n\\nThe editorial noted that ‚ÄúMichigan needs a lot from the federal government, including help managing the overwhelming number of unemployment claims that are suddenly being filed.‚Äù\\n\\nIn Michigan more than 311,000 people filed initial claims for unemployment insurance during the week ending on March 28, more than double from the week before.\\n\\n‚ÄúCitizens are better served if their leaders at all level of government set politics aside and work together,‚Äù the opinion piece continued. ‚ÄúPartisanship is unacceptable when lives are at stake.‚Äù\\n\\nIt went on to say that the Michigan governor should follow the examples of other Democratic governors like New York\\'s Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom of California who have ‚Äúfound a way to work collaboratively with the Trump administration.\"\\n\\n‚ÄúBoth have had differences with the president in the past, but they\\'ve set them aside for the good of their states,‚Äù the editorial said.\\n\\nCALIF. GOV. NEWSOM TELLS CNN TRUMP HAS BEEN \\'RESPONSIVE\\' TO STATE\\'S NEEDS: \\'I\\'D BE LYING\\' TO SAY OTHERWISE\\n\\nCuomo had acknowledged that the Trump administration was helping New York and Newsom commended President Trump for his attentiveness to the Golden State\\'s needs amid the coronavirus outbreak, saying he\\'d be \"lying\" if he said otherwise.\\n\\nDuring an interview last Wednesday, Newsom was pressed by CNN anchor Jake Tapper about whether the governor\\'s public praise for Trump was all in order to prevent him from \"punishing\" his state.\\n\\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd be lying to you to say that he hasn‚Äôt been responsive to our needs. He has,\" the governor said. \"And so, as a question, as a sort of an offer of objectivity, I have to acknowledge that publicly.\"\\n\\nWhitmer did not immediately respond to Fox News‚Äô request for comment regarding the editorial.\\n\\nHowever, speaking on ‚ÄúFox News Sunday‚Äù she told host Chris Wallace that none of the comments she has made have been personal and that she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúwage those kinds of political attacks.‚Äù\\n\\nShe said on Sunday that a better national strategy is needed to battle the coronavirus pandemic and that Trump‚Äôs assertion that the federal government should not be the first line of defense against the contagion is ‚Äúcreating a more porous situation.‚Äù\\n\\nWhitmer did say she was grateful for the 400 ventilators her state had received from the federal government and that she wasn‚Äôt waging any political attacks against Trump during the outbreak, but she added that the current ‚Äúpatchwork‚Äù approach to combatting the virus could lead to more people getting sick and dying.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nWhen Wallace asked Whitmer if politics is ‚Äúbeing played here both you towards the president and the president towards you,‚Äù she said ‚Äúnot on my part.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask to be thrust in the national spotlight,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like attacks frankly, but at the end of the day, my job, I‚Äôve been on this job for 15 months, my job is to do everything I can to protect the ten million people in Michigan.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúThat means locking arms with everyone who is going to be an ally and welcoming all people that want to be helpful and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre asking for help,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúNationally Michigan is a hot spot.

CUOMO, STOP DENYING NEW YORKERS HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE\\n\\nA recent intelligence community report confirms that disinformation began as early as November, when it misreported the seriousness of the disease. Based on Chinese reports, there was an outbreak of a serious, but not communicable disease that was easily contained in Wuhan.\\n\\nThat was false.\\n\\nThen, China misrepresented the seriousness of the coronavirus to the World Health Organization (WHO), which disregarded the more accurate data from Taiwan in December. Placating China‚Äôs animus toward Taiwan trumped saving lives, as far as the WHO was concerned. Based on false information supplied by China, the WHO actually advised against travel restrictions until Jan. 31, ensuring that precious time would be tragically lost.\\n\\nCredible sources state that China destroyed samples of the virus, shut down and punished doctors, detained citizen journalists, even welded people into their homes. When a proper medical response needed transparency, China‚Äôs misrepresentation of the facts directly led to the WHO‚Äôs disregarding the irrefutable reality.\\n\\nWe should not be surprised. As the former chairman of the House committee on global human rights and as the ranking member of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, I have held more than 60 hearings exposing over and over again how the Chinese government brutally abuses its people and operates in secrecy, instead of embracing a free media and its ability to inform people and hold officials and institutions accountable.\\n\\nThe blame for misrepresenting the nature of the coronavirus to the WHO lies at the highest levels of the Chinese government.\\n\\nNow we are facing a deadly pandemic and global economic recession that we can trace to China‚Äôs misrepresentations and malign influence in international institutions such as the WHO.\\n\\nWorld leaders must demand that China respect fundamental rights and recognize that media is a key institution that strengthens the ability of governments to address the critical needs of their citizens.\\n\\nThe blame for misrepresenting the nature of the coronavirus to the WHO lies at the highest levels of the Chinese government. China‚Äôs people deserve better from their leaders. Holding them accountable should begin with the WHO investigating this tragic course of events. China has inordinate influence at the WHO and other United Nations' bodies, where China now leads four specialized U.N. agencies. A country that does not adhere to the same norms that apply to other nations cannot be trusted to lead a U.N. agency. The world community must begin reassessing China‚Äôs role at the U.N. to begin the accountability process.\\n\\nBeyond that, Congress must launch serious efforts to curb Chinese influence operations. That means laws with teeth.\\n\\nTo that end, last year I introduced legislation with Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, HR 1811, to counter Chinese efforts to corrupt democratic institutions as well as to suppress information. This bill, co-sponsored by 10 members, underscores the need to differentiate between the great Chinese people and culture ‚Äì and to ensure Chinese Americans are never unjustly targeted ‚Äì from the brutal government of the People‚Äôs Republic, which all too often moves to intimidate the Chinese diaspora.\\n\\nI also introduced HR 1542, bipartisan legislation co-sponsored by Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., and 13 other members of Congress, to identify Chinese officials complicit in fentanyl production and its export to the United States. We have discovered that Chinese fentanyl mills also produce pharmaceuticals. As the need to diversity our supply chain beyond China has become glaringly apparent, we must also ensure that suppliers are not also fueling America‚Äôs opioid epidemic.\\n\\nWe can use the Global Magnitsky Act, of which I was the primary House sponsor, to hold accountable Chinese public security officials who targeted whistleblowers and members of the press in China.

In fact, there is evidence that it can be passed from one person to the next simply by speaking.\\n\\nAccumulating data from around the planet indicates that those infected are frequently symptom-free, or suffer from minor symptoms that are easily confused with other respiratory viruses. Therefore, it would seem that the only way to prevent spread in the absence of a vaccine or a significant community immunity (pandemics are too new for the population to have built up enough immunity to slow down the virus) would be social distancing, shutting down society and keeping as many people at home as possible. A recent study in Nature Medicine suggests that the use of surgical masks when worn in public may be helpful as wells.\\n\\nThis science-fiction image has become today‚Äôs reality. But there is another important tool that could ease the pressure and the focus on social distancing and obsessive disinfection as the only method to decrease the spread of this dangerous new virus.\\n\\nSEAN HANNITY: GOV. CUOMO, STOP DENYING NEW YORKERS HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE\\n\\nThis tool is testing, and by testing I do not mean not the long lines of cars awaiting the deep probe of a nasopharyngeal swab administered by a health care worker in a hazmat suit. Rather, the solution is to be found in rapid point-of-care testing, not only a self-administered nasal swab to see whether you have COVID-19 or not, but an accompanying finger prick for a drop of blood to test for immunity to the SARS COV 2 virus.\\n\\nThis week I spoke with Adm. (Dr.) Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for health. He is a member of President Trump‚Äôs coronavirus task force, and he has been put in the hot seat in charge of diagnostic testing since March 12. Dr. Giroir has marshalled the forces to bring what he says are now 41 mobile test sites around the country, leading to over a million COVID-19 tests over the past few weeks.\\n\\nBut the problem is that the testing is cumbersome, inefficient, often inaccurate and requires personal protective equipment that we would much prefer to see used in hospitals, clinics, doctor‚Äôs offices and ambulances. Plus, in most places there are only enough tests for the severely ill to receive them, which means that I and others have to diagnose our patients as having COVID 19 by clinical observations alone. This leads to too many people having it without knowing they have it, which increases the risk of spread despite all the social distancing and face mask-wearing.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nGiroir indicated to me that he thinks the solution to this problem is rapid point-of-care testing, both in terms of a molecular genetics-based test to determine active infection, as well as an immunoassay to test for antibodies against COVID-19. He likes Abbott‚Äôs Now platform, which has just released a COVID-19 test that can be used on the 18,000 units placed around the country ‚Äì and already used to test for influenza ‚Äì leading to 55,000 tests a day. Giroir told me he thinks the Abbott test is relatively accurate.\\n\\nThe test for antibodies against the virus can be done with a simple pinprick for a drop of blood and the results also determined immediately, but Giroir pointed out that there needs to be a standardization of quality before these antibody tests can be widely used. Not only that, but it isn‚Äôt yet clear what degree of Immunoglobin G and neutralizing antibodies are necessary to constitute long-term immunity against the SARS COV 2 virus.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nNevertheless, Giroir told me he believes that over the next few weeks we will have widely available (and quality controlled) rapid point-of-care tests for both infection, as well as recovered infection. This will be a game-changer when used to augment and even replace the ancient problematic techniques of shelter at home and social distancing that we are using now. We will be able to isolate and separate out people who really have the virus and then tell them when they are well enough to return to work. Known human islands of immunity will help us decrease disease spread.\\n\\nI am currently seeing dozens of COVID and potential COVID patients per week via telemedicine. Most of these patients are frightened, and they don‚Äôt know whether the vague symptoms they have add up to COVID or not. All too often, I can‚Äôt tell them, which means we as a society risk further spread from unidentified sources, a prospect we can no longer afford. Extensive on the spot testing can and will change all that.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DR.

We‚Äôve never seen anything like it in our lifetime.\\n\\nAs the figures increase every day, I think it‚Äôs important to remember that behind every number is a name of somebody who means the world to someone else. We‚Äôve learned that this virulent pathogen doesn‚Äôt discriminate ‚Äì it‚Äôs claimed the lives of people of countless nations and of all races, creeds and color ‚Äì both men and women, young and old.\\n\\nBy now, some of you may know someone who has succumbed to the virus. If so, I am so very sorry for your loss.\\n\\nPAUL BATURA: THE PALM SUNDAY THAT GAVE ME HOPE THE SUN WOULD SHINE AGAIN\\n\\nMy heart hurts when I see the rising number of fatalities. As a Christian, though, I can‚Äôt help but think about Heaven whenever I think about death. That‚Äôs because I strongly believe that death is not a final destination, but rather a transitionary step along life‚Äôs long and never-ending journey.\\n\\nThere‚Äôs an old saying that‚Äôs been put to music: ‚ÄúEverybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die.‚Äù\\n\\nI think that‚Äôs true. There‚Äôs a built-in will to live for almost all of us. It‚Äôs critical ‚Äì how else would we make it through tough times? Even though many of us look forward to the ‚Äúsweet bye and bye,‚Äù we are simultaneously working toward preserving the here and now.\\n\\nAs my colleague‚Äôs mother used to say, ‚ÄúHeaven is my home ‚Äì but I‚Äôm not yet homesick.‚Äù\\n\\nBut let‚Äôs take it from the ethereal and bring it down to the practical. What is Heaven really like?\\n\\nMy beliefs about eternity are informed mostly by the Bible. I‚Äôm also intrigued by some wonderfully descriptive testimonies of people who report having experienced what‚Äôs technically referred to as an ‚ÄúNDE‚Äù ‚Äì a near death experience.\\n\\nFirst, the Bible. We know from reading the Scriptures that Heaven is a real place ‚Äì full of real people. Its streets are paved with pure gold. The city described there, referred to as ‚ÄúNew Jerusalem,‚Äù is so enormous in size that it‚Äôs almost hard to fathom.\\n\\nAs we continue to pray and plead for an end to this catastrophic pandemic, I am reminded of the poignant words of the Irish poet Thomas Moore, who once observed, ‚ÄúEarth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal.‚Äù\\n\\nWe‚Äôre told it‚Äôs between 1,400 and 1,500 miles in width, length ‚Äì and height! In other words, New Jerusalem is a city with incredibly high walls ‚Äì yet a city that‚Äôs wide open with no closed gate.\\n\\nYet, Heaven is a lot more than a wonderfully attractive and massive place.\\n\\nI can‚Äôt wait to get there, because it‚Äôs a place with no pain, no sorrow, no tears ‚Äì and no more death. No more villainous viruses or cancerous tumors that take our loved ones and grieve our tender hearts.\\n\\nThroughout the last few weeks of this crisis, my wife, Jean, and I have been going to bed each night listening to a wonderful book, ‚ÄúImagine Heaven.‚Äù It‚Äôs written by a man named John Burke who has compiled over 100 NDEs and identified several main themes found from a wide array of people.\\n\\nAccording to those who have ‚Äúdied‚Äù and visited, Heaven is a place of overwhelming love. People repeatedly describe it as being so amazingly wonderful that they almost want to ‚Äúpop‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs how happy and joyous it is there.\\n\\nThose who give accounts of having been there and coming back also report that all of our senses are turbo-charged ‚Äì and there are more than the five we enjoy on earth. There‚Äôs no cosmic sun ‚Äì but God‚Äôs brilliance illuminates every corner of the celestial kingdom.\\n\\nFrom old men to young girls, the NDE holder describe the softness of the grass, the beauty of the trees and the colors and fragrant aromas of the many flowers.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nWhen you get there, you‚Äôre greeted by loved ones along with family members you never even knew existed. It‚Äôs the best party you‚Äôve ever been to, with singing and joy at every turn.\\n\\nListening to the NDE stories has actually caused my wife and I to not just long for eternity ‚Äì but to love life here on earth even more deliberately. It‚Äôs made us want to live with greater purpose and passion. As the late Dr. Billy Graham once said, ‚ÄúHeaven doesn‚Äôt make this life less important; it makes it more important.‚Äù\\n\\nWhen my time comes, I don‚Äôt want to limp into Heaven ‚Äì I want to run into it with the fervor and gusto of Teddy Roosevelt riding his favorite horse up San Juan Hill.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nMy personal faith in Jesus assures me that my inevitable and eventual death will usher in the beginning of the greatest adventure of my life.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of uplifting material (both Christian and secular) over the past few weeks encouraging people all over the world to use this time of isolation to self-reflect and better themselves.\\n\\nAll of this talk of self-improvement has made me wonder if there could be one universal goal every person could adopt at this unique time in history. I‚Äôm convinced we can all find inspiration from King Solomon‚Äôs life.\\n\\nKing Solomon was the third king appointed to reign over God‚Äôs chosen people, the Israelites. One night God appeared to Solomon in a dream and said, ‚ÄúAsk for whatever you want me to give you.‚Äù\\n\\nSAMARITAN\\'S PURSE HELPS FIGHT CORONAVIRUS IN NYC: \\'WE NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD BE IN THE UNITED STATES\\'\\n\\nSolomon could have abused this unique opportunity by treating God like a genie in a bottle, asking for power and wealth. Instead, he thanked God for His great kindness and humbly requested that God grant him a wise and discerning heart.\\n\\nIn turn, ‚ÄúGod gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore. Solomon‚Äôs wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East, and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt\" (1 Kings 4:29-30).\\n\\nThough Solomon lived thousands of years ago, the lessons of his life still apply to modern times. This period of extended isolation caused by the coronavirus has shaken up our daily routines and given the whole world fresh perspective about the things we should truly appreciate.\\n\\nAs we seek to reprioritize our own lives, let‚Äôs take a closer look at Solomon, the man who was given a supernatural opportunity to change his life forever, and who chose God‚Äôs wisdom as that vehicle for change.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nGod assures us in the New Testament that we can be granted this same wisdom if we truly believe we can receive it (James 1:5). But in order to truly desire God‚Äôs wisdom, we have to first realize that there are two different types of wisdom. One comes from God, and the other is motivated by our own selfish desires (James 3:15).\\n\\nWe can‚Äôt always trust our earthly wisdom. Despite how much we may think we are making decisions for ‚Äúgood‚Äù reasons, we have to understand that our judgment is clouded by sin, therefore we can‚Äôt trust our own discernment. So how do we know if the discernment we are using is coming from our own will or from God‚Äôs?\\n\\nJames 3 identifies the seven attributes of godly wisdom, which we can all use as a set of check points for decision-making: ‚ÄúBut the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere‚Äù (verses 17-18).\\n\\nThese are beautiful words ‚Äî but what do they mean in this context? We should consider each attribute one by one to guard ourselves from being influenced by our own untrustworthy thoughts.\\n\\n1. Wisdom from above is pure, meaning it has not been tainted by our sinful aspirations. Instead, it is completely aligned with God‚Äôs desires.\\n\\n2. It is peace-loving. It has others‚Äô best interests at heart and promotes unity rather than division.\\n\\n3. It is gentle. In other words, it reflects a deep respect and consideration for all of God‚Äôs children\\n\\n4. It is compliant, meaning it is submissive to the Holy Spirit, the will of God.\\n\\n5. It is full of mercy & good fruits. The decisions made with God‚Äôs discernment will bring forth peace and love rather than destruction and resentment.\\n\\n6. It is unwavering. It is not swayed by flattery, temptation or lies posing as truth\\n\\n7. It is sincere. Romans 12:9 tells us that this type of sincerity ‚Äúhates what is evil and clings to what is good.‚Äù\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIronically, though King Solomon did not ask God for riches and power, God ended up blessing Solomon with these earthly treasures as well because of his humble heart. Solomon would go on to write the majority of Proverbs, the book in the Bible-centered on the benefits of godly wisdom. He wrote in Proverbs 16:16 ‚ÄúHow much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver!‚Äù\\n\\nKnowing that Solomon actually had both wisdom AND riches and still valued wisdom above his earthly treasures should encourage all of us to put our effort toward aligning our hearts with God‚Äôs.\\n\\n‚ÄúThe one who gets wisdom loves life; the one who cherishes understanding will soon prosper‚Äù (Proverbs 19:8).\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHRISTEN LIMBAUGH BLOOM', 'author': ['Christen Limbaugh Bloom', 'Christen Limbaugh Bloom Is The Creator Of Haplous', 'A Christian Blog For Women Seeking Peace In A Stressful World.

That‚Äôs bunk. The American people aren‚Äôt stupid. They don‚Äôt expect Trump to manufacture economic prosperity during a pandemic.\\n\\nAs in any crisis, what people expect is leadership, and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre getting. As the polls demonstrate, they know it.\\n\\nSo, to paraphrase Mark Twain, rumors of the president\\'s political demise have been greatly exaggerated. This is nothing new. Dating back to when he was a candidate, Trump‚Äôs detractors have been inaccurately claiming he was ‚Äúfinished‚Äù only to be proven wrong again and again.\\n\\nMICHIGAN REVERSES COURSE ON TRUMP-TOUTED CORONAVIRUS DRUGS\\n\\nFirst, it was firing disgraced FBI Director James Comey that would supposedly doom the Trump presidency. Then it was Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù of baseless Democratic conspiracy theories. Then it was the pathetic attempt to remove the president from office over an innocent phone call with a foreign head of state.\\n\\nNow, the same clueless pundits are writing the president\\'s epitaph again, deeming the coronavirus pandemic his political kryptonite, ghoulishly focusing on politics while people are dying.\\n\\nAmidst the economic disruption necessary to defeat COVID-19, some Democrats seem to think that even former Vice President Joe Biden might have a chance of winning the White House if millions of Americans are still experiencing pandemic-related economic hardship.\\n\\nAs with every other supposed ‚ÄúTrump is done‚Äù moment dating back to 2015, the president‚Äôs critics are sorely mistaken. The American people are intelligent enough to understand the president will be unable to manufacture a booming economy in the midst of this pandemic. Rather than achieving impossible results, history clearly shows us that, in times such as these, its leadership that matters most.\\n\\nIn the 1930s and 40s, Americans suffered through more than a decade of economic depression and four years of world war. President Franklin Roosevelt didn‚Äôt win four consecutive terms because he promised to magically bring back the prosperity of the Roaring ‚Äò20s, but rather because the American people trusted him to lead them through the storm.\\n\\nSimilarly, the British Parliament did not select Winston Churchill to lead them in May 1940 ‚Äî nearly a year into the Second World War ‚Äî because they thought he could return peace and prosperity by November. They chose him because their nation needed leadership to carry it through the difficult times that lay ahead.\\n\\nThese are similarly difficult times and Americans are finding the leadership they seek in this president. His job approval rating on the RealClear Politics average of the polls stands at the highest level of his presidency, up sharply since the crisis began. According to a recent Gallup poll, 60 percent of Americans approve of the president\\'s response to the coronavirus.\\n\\nConversely, only 44 percent approve of the news media‚Äôs behavior during the crisis, while 55 percent disapprove.\\n\\nAmericans know that until the Trump boom was blunted by an unforeseen pandemic, his policies delivered three uninterrupted years of rising incomes, full employment, economic growth and industrial revitalization. It wasn\\'t any policy failure that put millions out of work. Rather, it‚Äôs because of the Trump administration‚Äôs forward-looking policy that $2.2 trillion is being spent to relieve the economic suffering of those who have been hurt by this national emergency.\\n\\nThe people trust that this president can quickly restore the country to economic health once it‚Äôs safe to resume normal activities. A new Washington Post-ABC poll finds not only that Trump is enjoying the highest overall approval rating of his entire presidency, but that those surveyed trust Trump to handle the economy more than Biden by 10 full points.\\n\\nThe polls also show that voters are more likely to trust Trump than Biden when it comes to handling the coronavirus outbreak itself. If you‚Äôve seen any of Biden‚Äôs recent media appearances, those results will come as no surprise.\\n\\nThe president is out in front, leading, just as the American people expect. His daily press briefings are widely watched and are proving invaluable to Americans as we weather this storm together.\\n\\nIn fact, they‚Äôre so effective, far-left MSNBC host Rachel Maddow wants the president off the air, arguing that the networks should simply ‚Äústop broadcasting‚Äù the popular briefing. New York Times columnist David Brooks agrees. Appearing on the \"PBS NewsHour,\" he was even more direct, expressing his desire to ‚Äúget Mike Pence and especially Donald Trump off the air.‚Äù\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTalk about endorsements! Apparently, even anti-Trump journalists predicting that the Trump presidency will be the most high-profile casualty of the coronavirus pandemic are looking at the polls and coming to realize that they are deluding themselves ‚Äî and their viewers and readers.\\n\\nThe American people know genuine leadership when we see it, and the leadership President Trump is demonstrating right now instills confidence that he has what it takes to guide us through this storm and revive our economy when it ends ‚Äì and it will end.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDY PUZDER', 'author': ['Andy Puzder']}, {'link': 'http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/W--c45kAEiw/paul-batura-palm-sunday-sun-shine', 'published': '2020-04-05T11:00:39', 'title': 'Paul Batura: The Palm Sunday that gave me hope the sun would shine again', 'text': 'Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.

I looked around and wished I could be so happy. Instead, I remember feeling disconnected, nervous and out of sorts. It was only then that I understood what the writer C.S. Lewis once wrote, that ‚ÄúNo one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.‚Äù\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nAs the young kids of the church processed up the aisle to open the service wearing their red robes and waving palm branches, we sang the words of the traditional Palm Sunday hymn: ‚ÄúAll glory, laud and honor, To thee, Redeemer, King, To whom the lips of children, Made sweet hosannas ring.\"\\n\\nThe sight of the fresh-faced kids and then singing the line about children was almost too much for me. Would we ever have a child processing up the aisle with a palm branch in their hand? After so many years of disappointment, it was beginning to seem increasingly unlikely.\\n\\nAs a young boy, Palm Sunday always struck me as something of an odd outlier of a celebration. To go from the soberness of Lent to the festiveness of a royal procession ‚Äì and then so quickly to the tragedy of Good Friday and then Jesus‚Äô crucifixion and resurrection three days later seemed so whipsaw.\\n\\nHow can your fortunes swing so rapidly, from triumph to tragedy and then to triumph again?\\n\\nOver the years, I‚Äôve grown to see that Jesus‚Äô wild week is something of a metaphor for our lives. If you‚Äôre not in trouble today, hold on ‚Äì you‚Äôre headed for it. But if you are in a dire predicament, don‚Äôt despair ‚Äì the tide that goes out will always come back in.\\n\\nGod is always at work, even in the midst of great tragedy like the coronavirus. And yes, even in the lives of an infertile couple desperately praying for a baby.\\n\\nIn fact, I‚Äôve come to believe that it‚Äôs when God seems most absent that He is often doing His greatest work.\\n\\nBut the very real substance of Palm Sunday is not that good things can come from bad. It‚Äôs that God often uses the weak and powerless to demonstrate true strength. It‚Äôs a reminder that He turns the wisdom and ways of the world upside down all the time.\\n\\nOn that first Palm Sunday, Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a baby donkey ‚Äì hardly a symbol of strength and might. In that scene, I think we‚Äôre reminded that all of us are entirely dependent upon God. He doesn‚Äôt do things like we do things, which is why we often don‚Äôt understand what He‚Äôs up to, especially now in the chaos of COVID-19.\\n\\nSitting in that church that Sunday morning, lamenting our lot and choking back tears, my eyes wandered to a notice in the bulletin announcing the next week‚Äôs Easter Sunday sermon. It was to be preached by our pastor, and it was to be his last. Retiring after 34 years at the helm of First Presbyterian Church, Dr. John H. Stevens had selected for his theme a subject that lifted me from my despair: ‚ÄúThe Difference a Day Can Make.‚Äù\\n\\nPalm Sunday‚Äôs cry of ‚ÄúHosanna!‚Äù ‚Äì which means ‚ÄúGod save us!‚Äù ‚Äì was a desperate plea 2,000 years ago and an appropriate one now in our world‚Äôs time of need.\\n\\nThe coming of Easter is a reminder to hold up and hang on. One day can make all the difference, indeed.\\n\\nGod never answered our prayer, at least in the way we were praying.

But figuring out how specifically to acquire relief for your business is trickier and may seem like a daunting task when faced with well over 1,000 pages of legislation. Where do you even begin?\\n\\nThis week, I cut through the confusion on my podcast ‚ÄúNewt‚Äôs World‚Äù with my guest, Elaine Parker, president of the Job Creators Network Foundation.

Specifically, this program provides forgivable loans to any business with 500 employees or less. Gig workers, independent contractors, sole proprietors, and restaurant or hotel companies with 500 employees or less can all receive these loans.\\n\\nUnder the PPP, small businesses are eligible to borrow 250 percent of their average monthly payroll expenses, up to a total of $10 million. (Compensation over an annual salary of $100,000 is excluded.) These loans can be used for an array of expenses, with the goal of helping businesses retain their employees. To that end, businesses that lay off employees will see their debt forgiveness reduced by the percentage they decreased their staff.\\n\\nImportantly, these loans are available from any local or national bank that is approved to make Small Business Administration loans or is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Business owners do not even need to contact any government agency to apply\\n\\nI go into much more detail about the PPP in my podcast for anyone with specific questions.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., tested positive for the coronavirus and stayed away from the Senate for the historic vote on a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill passed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nPaul isn‚Äôt the only member of Congress to test positive for the coronavirus. In the House, members who have said they tested positive include Reps. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C.; Mike Kelly, D-Pa.; Nydia Valazquez, D-N.Y.; Ben McAdams, D-Utah; and Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.\\n\\nAnd over two dozen members of the House and Senate self-quarantined after saying they had been near someone with coronavirus and feared they may have contracted COVID-19. Acting responsibly, they said they didn‚Äôt want to take the chance of spreading the disease to anyone else.\\n\\nA politician‚Äôs life consists of interaction with the public and other politicians, so more members of Congress could easily fall ill, especially if they gather together in meeting rooms and on the House and Senate floors.\\n\\nAnd many members are in their 60s and 70s, putting them at greater risk of serious illness and death than their younger colleagues if they come down with COVID-19. A report in March by the Congressional Research Service said the average age of current House members is 57.6 years and the average age of senators is 62.9 years.\\n\\nThe two oldest current members of Congress are Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska. Both are 85.\\n\\nWhile under current rules in the House and Senate members must show up in person to cast votes in each chamber, each body could vote to change its rules to allow remote voting.\\n\\nInterest in remote voting is bicameral and bipartisan.\\n\\nMassachusetts Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern has sought temporary changes to the rules that govern the way the House conducts its business, and he has been petitioned by 67 of his colleagues to allow for remote voting.

Durbin and Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman to allow remote votes in emergency situations.\\n\\nWhile it may seem a bit churlish to raise security concerns at this time of national crisis, it is worth taking a brief pause to consider whether and how Congress can safely and securely conduct the nation‚Äôs business away from the Capitol.\\n\\nWe certainly have the technology to allow Congress to conduct most of its business remotely, as many Americans are learning as they work from home, plug in their headphones, and log into virtual meetings through platforms like Zoom, GoToMeeting and Microsoft Teams.\\n\\nHowever, malicious actors and just plain bad people are already using the current coronavirus crisis to sow discord, spread misinformation and take advantage of people.\\n\\nThe business of Congress could be a particularly attractive target for those who would seek to disrupt American democracy, whether through denial of service attacks on these services or ‚Äìeven worse ‚Äì using deep-fakes and other artificial intelligence-enabled technology to impersonate members of Congress.\\n\\nIn the Senate, bills are voted on generally through a roll-call vote. For the House, however, a roll call of 435 members is arduous and time consuming, so it most often relies on electronic voting in the chamber when needed.\\n\\nThis only accounts for the bills once they have passed through a relevant committee, which also would need to hold votes. If Congress is to continue functioning even as more of its members fall ill or self-quarantine, it could consider prudently, but expeditiously, how it can support telework for its members and staff.\\n\\nTo ensure the integrity of congressional voting processes, a strongly encrypted connection for every member would be required.

Now, she's passing her insights on to others.\\n\\nApril 5, 2020 5 min read\\n\\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\\n\\nPeak performance ‚Äî it‚Äôs something just about everyone strives for. There are countless diets, books, blogs, TV shows and more dedicated to becoming your best self and operating at your highest capacity, both in business and in life. The question is, can it actually be done?\\n\\nWhile most focus on just one facet of self-care (weight, productivity, nutrition, motivation, etc.), social entrepreneur and biohacker Lian Pham‚Äôs approach is all-inclusive and comprehensive. With her Peak Performance Pyramid, Pham ‚Äî who, full disclosure, is a client of mine, but whose perspective I felt was valuable to share during these challenging times ‚Äî has worked out a system of steps that include biohacking the mind, body and spirit to reach peak performance across the boards. Here's how she did it, as well her tips on how you can, too.\\n\\nWhat led to your becoming so interested in peak performance?\\n\\nAfter the birth of my second child, I suddenly became very, very ill. I went to every hospital, every specialist, but found no explanation for my severe headaches, numbness and hypokalemia. I knew that something was wrong and that answers must be out there. I just had to find them. I never gave up, and eventually, after countless tests and scans, I was diagnosed with Bell's palsy.\\n\\nWith this diagnosis came a sense of urgency. I decided to apply my philosophy of assuming nothing and pursuing everything to my health and immediately got to work building a biohacking lab behind my house to experiment in. This is how I finally began to actually feel better. After going through this entire process for myself, I realized that we all have this unusual power to make ourselves healthier and stronger, so I set to work quantifying the process I used to get well again. This resulted in The Peak Performer Pyramid, a series of interdependent steps that I and now many others have followed.\\n\\nWhat should people first understand about the fundamentals of peak performance?\\n\\nWe‚Äôre not just biohacking our bodies; we‚Äôre biohacking every part that makes us whole. With each of these steps fulfilled, through sustainable, daily habits, peak performance is realized.\\n\\nWe are all ‚Äî mind, body and soul ‚Äî unique, and anyone can make peak performance their lifestyle.\\n\\nHow would you best characterize biohacking and how do you apply it to help yourself and others?\\n\\nBiohacking is a very broad term and can mean different things for different people, but in essence, and for me, it means becoming the writer of your own health story. It means taking your health and self-awareness into your own hands, to understand yourself and optimize your performance, often outside the realm of traditional medicine.\\n\\nI think biohacking should be applied to every facet of life ‚Äî from our food, to the equipment at the office, to the tactics we use in business and beyond. Only if we biohack the physical, mental and spiritual can we perform at our best at all times. For me, this started with buying countless test kits for myself to find out the state of my DNA, my microbiome, my micronutrients and so on. From there, I was able to build myself a roadmap for my health to progress through.\\n\\nRelated: 4 Joyless Ways to Biohack Your Way to Higher Productivity\\n\\nWhat new biohacking trends or processes are on the horizon that you expect to impact performance?\\n\\nSince I believe biohacking extends beyond just the body, I will break this down into a few categories. For physical health, I‚Äôm using custom IV packs to handle any nutritional deficiencies quickly and easily, ozone therapy to improve the body's intake and use of oxygen to activate the immune system. I‚Äôm also eating plant-based, balancing my microbiome (arguably the second brain of the body), doing Tabata (a type of HIIT workout), taking MCT oil, using red light therapy, infrared sauna and cold plunges, taking quick headstand breaks and more.\\n\\nAt work, we snack regularly because it isn‚Äôt distracting or unprofessional ‚Äî it‚Äôs brain food. For the mind, I recommend NAD in nasal spray or IV form to increase cognitive function and BrainTap for technologic guided meditation, to name just a few. And to biohack the soul, one must practice mindfulness, self-awareness and consciousness to become fully aware beyond just flesh and brain matter. A lifestyle habit I use to biohack the soul is working with crystals to set my daily intentions and goals, to feel more grounded, connected and centered.\\n\\nIn the end, biohacking will look different for every person. That‚Äôs the beauty of it; it‚Äôs tailored to everyone‚Äôs unique needs.\\n\\nRelated: Why Biohacking Is the Latest Major Startup Trend\\n\\nWhat‚Äôs the single most important piece of advice for someone looking to achieve peak performance?\\n\\nDon‚Äôt be a bystander ‚Äî be a disruptor for good. How? Assume nothing, pursue everything. Be proactive, be optimistic. Persevere. Realize your power, your vision, and do something with it. Know that peak performance is not just a fad, it is a lifestyle. First, you must make the decision to take your health, your life and your performance into your own hands and then you must follow through on it. It is the companies that cultivate a sense of meaning, belonging and heart in the workplace that will dominate the future.

Too little prevents salespeople from laying the foundation for good relationships. Is there a middle ground?\\n\\nAccording to a new study from Accenture, 80 percent of frequent B2B buyers changed providers in a 24-month period. To avoid falling victim to heavy churn, entrepreneurs and their sales teams can't afford to play a guessing game with prospect touchpoints.\\n\\nMastering the art of communication frequency requires a careful balance, though. Not only must salespeople make prospects feel appreciated and valued, but they must also spend as much time as possible bringing in new business. Relationships are great, but when prospects with a limited budget and finicky demands ask for too much time, salespeople need to know when to let go.\\n\\nRelated: Grow Your Business on a Budget With This DIY Landing Page Service\\n\\nWhat makes one touchpoint better than another when trying to grow your business?\\n\\nEngaging with prospects is a dance. The best salespeople and entrepreneurs understand when to push the tempo and when to let the other party set the pace. Pick the wrong tactic at the wrong moment, and a once-interested prospect will quickly start looking for a new partner.\\n\\nIn this new decade, where data intelligence and personalization have become the expectation, sellers must add value to the buyer journey at every touchpoint. Instead of asking whether someone is ready to purchase, salespeople should provide more context, point to other relevant resources and ensure prospects feel they‚Äôre in control.\\n\\nClose more sales with more qualified prospects by making the most of these critical touchpoints:\\n\\n1. A better version of a first email.\\n\\nMarketing may handle this early exchange, but regardless of who‚Äôs responsible, a good first impression sets the stage for trust on both sides.\\n\\nExperienced salespeople understand that the first outreach isn‚Äôt truly the beginning of the relationship. Prospects today view all sorts of media and materials online and in print before taking an action that generates an email. However, by turning this first opportunity to engage into something special, salespeople can differentiate themselves in the eyes of people looking to purchase.\\n\\nInstead of sending a standard cold email inviting prospects to ask questions, try a video greeting. Maintain a few professional standards for lighting and sound, but don‚Äôt get hung up on the details. Use the information the prospect submitted to create a short video, and include a few tips or next steps. Then, send the email and wait for the (now much more likely) reply.\\n\\nRelated: Losing Control May Help Grow Your Business\\n\\n2. Engagement without encroachment on social media.\\n\\nMaintaining an active presence on social media provides a host of benefits for young companies. In sales, social media allows brands and representatives to connect directly with prospects on a level that feels comfortable for both parties.\\n\\nLimit social media engagement to brand-owned channels and appropriate public spaces. Remember, the goal is to continue the conversation, not to get blocked or reported as spam. Inviting people to send messages with questions is fine, but don‚Äôt DM people about special promotions unless they ask explicitly.\\n\\nBrands, on average, post 23 times as much promotional content as responses to prospect questions on social channels. Get users involved by answering questions as often as possible and posting more user-generated content. Maintain an active presence with real humans during business hours; when the doors close, lean on chatbots to continue the conversation and provide context for future prospect engagement.\\n\\n3. Smart outreach at natural moments.\\n\\nToday‚Äôs buyers know that companies track their online movements and email open rates. While prospects prefer to maintain privacy, companies can't let their collected data go to waste. Smart outreach based on good data, using workflow automation and appropriate tools, empowers businesses to connect with prospects in the moments when they're most willing to move down the funnel.\\n\\nFor example, say a prospect usually opens emails and clicks links but has yet to reach out for more information. Workflow automation tools can identify these opportunities for meaningful touchpoints and either prompt salespeople to reach out or send automated responses. In some cases, this could be a perfect opportunity for a follow-up video email.\\n\\nRelated: Learn How to Grow Your Business on a Budget By Outsourcing\\n\\nDon‚Äôt let best practices and other businesses dictate what qualifies as smart outreach. Different companies and prospect pools prioritize different things. One whitepaper download might matter less to a software business than three email click-throughs matter for a machinery and equipment sales company.\\n\\nIn the dance of prospecting, pitching, and closing, don‚Äôt get caught doing the tango with prospects looking for a waltz. Consider the most important touchpoints for the target audience, optimize communications to make the most of those opportunities and start having more productive conversations.\", 'author': ['Tiffany Delmore']}, {'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/6h3fGjUvtH0/348667', 'published': '2020-04-04T17:30:00', 'title': \"What It's Like to Become a Streaming Sensation\", 'text': 'Video game streamer and YouTuber Kristen Michaela, aka KittyPlays, talks about the growth of competitive gaming and what it means to be a content creator.\\n\\nApril 4, 2020 1 min read\\n\\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\\n\\nKristen Michaela (aka KittyPlays), a video game streamer and YouTuber, provides her insights on some of the common misconceptions about esports.

Amidst the huge human toll and ongoing suffering, businesses are having to change the way they operate, as well as the way they market their products and services.\\n\\nGiven the gravity of the current situation and the worldwide panic surrounding it, it‚Äôs easy for advertisers to make critical mistakes ‚Äî blunders that could stay with them long after the coronavirus crisis has passed. Here are five things all advertisers should consider when navigating the tricky waters of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\n1. The public is deeply worried.\\n\\nMarketing in the midst of a global pandemic is always a delicate proposition. First and foremost, you need to know where people are coming from and what they are focused on, because their needs have understandably changed. For the time being, people are rightly concerned about their health and the health of their families, and everything else is taking a back seat.\\n\\nRelated: New Stimulus Bill Unlocks IRA and 401(k) Dollars for Financially Affected\\n\\nYou can respond by ratcheting back sales pitches and providing reassuring messages instead.

People are concerned about finances.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 crisis has had a far-reaching ripple effect throughout the economy that has sent the stock market reeling. This means that even as people worry about their personal health and that of their loved ones, they‚Äôre also stressed about their finances ‚Äî from credit card bills to owed taxes.\\n\\nAs an advertiser, you can respond to these concerns by offering special pricing, new financing deals and other incentives designed to set people's minds at ease. From car dealers offering a break in payments for COVID-19 patients to landlords being flexible on rent, these messages resonate strongly in these troubled times. Being human and transparent is key.\\n\\nStandout Advertisement: H&R Block ‚Äî A Lot Going On\\n\\n3. Businesses are expected to do their part.\\n\\nIf the COVID-19 crisis has taught us anything, it is that everyone is in this together. From the restaurant on the corner to the big airlines, every business is navigating this crisis in its own way.\\n\\nAt the same time, businesses are expected to do their part, so use this opportunity to talk about what you're doing to help. Many businesses have already announced that they are continuing to pay their employees and providing additional sick time, and these marketing messages can be very powerful.\\n\\nStandout Advertisement: San Pellegrino ‚Äî Helping Restaurants in Need\\n\\n4. Shoppers are focused on the basics.\\n\\nAs the COVID-19 crisis ramps up and people practice social distancing, consumers are pulling back. Shoppers are focused on the basics ‚Äî the items they need to sustain themselves and their families in this time of travel restrictions and worries about disease transmission.\\n\\nYou can respond to this new reality by focusing your marketing efforts on the products in highest demand.

The economy was great, people were optimistic, and the overall outlook was very good. I am sure that most of you can remember how hard it was to hire good staff members just a few months ago because the job market was so strong. Now, we just had the largest number of single-week unemployment filings in history.\\n\\nI serve as an executive coach to many franchisors and franchise owners around the world. Usually, tragedies are localized. I have had many conversations over the years where the person on the other end reported a regional disaster like a hurricane or earthquake, and we\\'ve offered support and encouragement. But while on a Zoom call with a client in Australia a few days ago, they were suffering the same exact crisis that we are here in Colorado. That is when I realized that we are truly all in this together.\\n\\nWhen we get down to real-world fears, the biggest question I\\'m hearing is, ‚ÄúHow do we survive this?‚Äù And that\\'s when it\\'s time to deploy hard-hitting coaching strategies that have an immediate impact on operations, people and revenue.\\n\\nAs I\\'m coaching my clients, they\\'re sharing their entrepreneurial solutions to the current crisis with me, and their stories of perseverance and innovation inspired me to do my part to give back to the franchise industry that I love.\\n\\nRelated: How to Prepare for Major Supply Chain Distribution\\n\\nSo, we are going to work together to get through this temporary crisis and help save as many businesses and jobs as humanly possible.

Many times, coaching can help them see things more clearly so they can make better decisions and keep fighting against diversity.\\n\\nIntroducing: the Fight For Your Franchise Challenge, a 90-day program to keep people focused on positive strategies to get them through the stress and negative circumstances that are currently hitting small businesses.

You will hear from franchisors and franchise operators that are innovating new ways of doing business in this ever-changing business environment.\\n\\nFranchisors and franchise vendors can also sign up to join our \"Wall of Fame\" to show support for the initiative, and they can also request to be a guest on one of our sessions or podcasts. We can get through this together, and the more we support each other, the more businesses will be spared.\\n\\nThe first week we will focus on getting in the right mindset for navigating the crisis waters. The first step in the process is to make sure that we don‚Äôt allow negative thoughts, beliefs and fears to drive our behavior in the wrong direction. The 12-week program will help everyone stay in the right mindset to strive toward success. Nobody has to be alone during this crisis.

Its in-house assistants can help you find new leads and evaluate prospects, prepare important business proposals and contracts, create engaging digital marketing materials and posts that will capture a wider audience, create eye-catching website content, as well as design email campaigns.\\n\\nIf you really just need help with those day-to-tasks bogging you down, Time Etc can help there, too.

Simply put, Time Etc will give you more time to focus on the projects that really move the needle of your business.\\n\\nPricing for Time Etc starts at a reasonable $250 a month or just $25 an hour for a U.S.-based, dedicated assistant.

Make Sure You Understand Digital ADA Compliance', 'text': \"Any business's online presence must comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.\\n\\nApril 3, 2020 5 min read\\n\\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\\n\\nAs the old cliche goes, ‚ÄúPresentation is everything.‚Äù Having great content for your website is an important starting point, but ensuring that it is presented in an appealing way will make all the difference in whether visitors stick around. Unfortunately, far too many companies and brands ignore the needs of users with disabilities when implementing a design update or launching a brand new site. And this can prove costly, as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is increasingly being viewed as applicable to websites and mobile apps.\\n\\nThe result? Celebrities like Beyonc√© and major corporations like Domino‚Äôs are getting sued when disabled users find themselves unable to fully use their websites. Domino‚Äôs especially has faced negative press.\\n\\nEven without lawsuits, failure to make web accessibility a priority could result in significant losses for your business. The 2019 Click-Away Pound Survey found that 69 percent of individuals with disabilities ‚Äú‚Äòclick away from a site with [access] barriers.‚Äù Despite this, only 8 percent contact site owners about their problems. This means a non-ADA compliant site could be losing money without your even knowing it. As such, few things are more important than making sure you address the needs of those with visual, auditory, mobility and other disabilities.\\n\\nStart With the Basics\\n\\nAn analysis of 10,000,000 web pages conducted by accessiBe revealed that the vast majority of compliance issues occur with seemingly basic elements of web design. An incredible 98 percent of websites had noncompliant menus, and 83 percent failed to utilize accessible buttons, while 89 percent had noncompliant popups.\\n\\nWhere did the accessibility problems stem from? In the majority of cases, noncompliance issues came from a failure to offer alternative methods of navigating through these common design elements.\\n\\nAs just one example, sites should offer the ability to navigate the menu bar with keyboard arrows, open dropdown functions with the enter key and move to the next element with the tab key. A failure to implement all of these features could cause a motor-impaired user to waste several minutes.\\n\\nA related problem is when content or actions are subjected to a timer, an especially common issue during the checkout process. Giving users an option to turn off, extend or adjust timers will ensure that they aren‚Äôt kicked out of a session before they can finish their purchase.\\n\\nSuch navigation issues can get even harder with popups. If a user can‚Äôt close the popup by pressing the escape key, they may not be able to close out of it at all. From voice-friendly search to keyboard-only navigation, you must consider alternative methods.\\n\\nRelated: 5 Steps to Make Sure Your Website Is ADA-Compliant\\n\\nProvide Alternative Content-Delivery Methods\\n\\nAnother common web-compliance issue comes with the delivery of your content. Do your images have alt text so someone using a screen reader can still get the information conveyed by the picture? Are there text transcripts for video-only or audio-only content? Do your videos provide closed captioning?\\n\\nAs your website expands the type of content it offers in an effort to grow its audience, you will need to ensure that each new piece of content is accessible to all. And this likely won‚Äôt be as time-consuming as you might think. For example, if your website is publishing an infographic, ADA compliance would entail supplying the full copy of the infographic in a text format below the image. As part of the process of creating the infographic, the text would likely already have been produced in a standalone format, so all you need to do is add this to the bottom of the page.\\n\\nPresentation Matters\\n\\nADA-compliant presentation goes beyond making sure that each section of the site uses proper HTML or tagging. Remember, not everyone that could have trouble reading your web content will be using a screen reader.\\n\\nFor example, there must be adequate color contrast between the site‚Äôs text and background. Color alone is not enough to convey information. Font should be in an easy-to-read text that is still legible when users zoom in. Web pages should avoid series of flashes that could trigger a seizure or other severe physical reaction.\\n\\nThe overall site layout ‚Äî especially navigational elements ‚Äî should stay the same no matter what page someone visits on. Form fields should always be clearly labeled so users know what information is required. A cohesive, well-designed site will benefit everyone who visits your page ‚Äî not just those with disabilities.\\n\\nRelated: Even Internet Entrepreneurs Need to Make Their Businesses Handicap Accessible\\n\\nDon‚Äôt Make ADA Compliance an Afterthought\\n\\nThis is just a quick overview, and I strongly recommend reading the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines from the Web Accessibility Initiative for a full understanding of how to improve your site.\\n\\nWhile the way the ADA is being enforced in the digital world is still subject to debate, site owners should prioritize making it a key part of their design from the get-go. By improving the online experience for all users, you can better serve your customers and protect yourself against potential legal harm.\", 'author': ['Lucas Miller']}, {'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/qQFwc4NmDLo/342862', 'published': '2020-04-03T19:30:00', 'title': '3 Tricks for Getting More Email Clicks', 'text': 'Many marketers will tell you their engagement rates need to improve.

Are you sending valuable content? You‚Äôll see the feedback reflected in your open and click rates. Is your email list accurate? Your bounce rates, spam complaints and other metrics will show you. If those numbers aren‚Äôt making you happy, it‚Äôs in your power to improve them.\\n\\nTo see where you stand, let‚Äôs take a look at industry benchmarks. These vary depending on the source, so it‚Äôs difficult to establish what the most precise data is. Dave Chaffey of Smart Insights published an in-depth study on the topic, gathering information from several email-service providers. Here‚Äôs what he found after analyzing hundreds of millions of sends:\\n\\nThe average open rate, across all industries, varies from 14.79 percent (Constant Contact) to 21.33 percent (MailChimp).\\n\\nThe average click-through rate ranges between 2.98 percent (Get Response) to 6.99 percent (Constant Contact).\\n\\nThere‚Äôs a significant difference between these numbers, but they should give you some perspective on how your own emails are performing. What can you do if your metrics are below these benchmarks, or if you want your email marketing to be even more effective? The below tactics will help you do just that.\\n\\nRelated: 5 Tips for Better Email Marketing Performance\\n\\n1.

We‚Äôve had customers come to us with a 20 percent bounce rate, and after they validated their list, that rate went down to less than 1 percent.\\n\\nNick Dimitriou, the head of growth at email-marketing service Moosend, confirms how important email hygiene is. ‚ÄúWhile content and volume greatly influence your email deliverability,‚Äù Dimitriou told me, ‚Äúthe quality of your mailing list also has an impact. To increase engagement, verify whether your contacts are valid and deliverable, and do it regularly.‚Äù\\n\\nSo how exactly do you go about checking the quality of your list? ‚ÄúUsing a good email validation system helps you remove bad contacts from your list and boosts your overall performance,\" Dimitriou added. \"This way, you avoid the risk of being filtered out by mailbox providers, and you have peace of mind knowing you communicate with real people.\"\\n\\nRelated: 5 Automated Email-Marketing Messages You Should Be Using\\n\\n2. Test your content for what works best.\\n\\nOnce you know your list is in good shape, it‚Äôs time to take a closer look at your content. Start by analyzing your metrics from the past six months. What type of emails got the highest engagement?\\n\\nA few aspects to focus on:\\n\\nWhat responses did you get on transactional emails versus marketing offers versus newsletters?\\n\\nOut of your offers and newsletters, which emails tended to have the highest open and click rates?\\n\\nDoes your audience prefer short messages, or is it more inclined to read longer emails?\\n\\nWhich worked better: plain-text or HTML?\\n\\nIt‚Äôs essential to compare your emails against each other before you start tweaking for better results. Everything can be adjusted, but first, pay attention to what your subscribers like so you can give them more of that.\\n\\nWhen it comes to writing, there are plenty of tactics that boost engagement. In a recent interview with Zero Bounce, copywriter Laura Belgray advised: ‚ÄúWrite conversationally, as if you‚Äôre writing to one friend ‚Äî not formally, to a group. Put effort into the subject line, making it intriguing and also informal, as it‚Äôs from a friend.‚Äù\\n\\nAccording to research from Business2Community, 47 percent of people decide whether to open an email just by scanning the subject line. Try Belgray‚Äôs suggestions next time you write yours.\\n\\n3. Score your contacts to identify the ones most likely to engage.\\n\\nList hygiene and content play an essential role in your inbox placement and engagement rates, but what if you‚Äôve validated your list and improved your content, and you still can‚Äôt seem to get better responses? You could take things a step further and try an email-scoring service. The process is similar to cleaning your list, but you get more in-depth data.\\n\\nAn email-scoring system examines every email address in your database and assigns a score to each. Based on the activity levels it detects, the system predicts how likely a certain email user is to engage with your messages. A low score indicates the address is inactive and thus unlikely to react. The higher the score, the more you can focus on those contacts and re-engage them with targeted campaigns.\\n\\nEmail scoring helps you learn more about your subscribers‚Äôs behavior before you even email them. By allowing you to make every email count, it can save time and resources.\\n\\nRelated: This Is Why Email Marketing Still Outperforms Social Media\\n\\nHere are a few final, bonus pointers to help boost open and click-through rates:', 'author': ['Liviu Tanase']}, {'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/jnGs6E2pgIg/348710', 'published': '2020-04-03T18:00:00', 'title': '8 Ways Business Owners Can Take Advantage of the Federal Stimulus Package', 'text': 'From loans to unemployment and more, opportunities are abundant. Act now.\\n\\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\\n\\nThere is a strategy to maximizing all the benefits of Congress\\'s recent $2 trillion stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It‚Äôs not just applying for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) or tapping into your 401k. In fact, there are actually eight key pieces to the legislation that can assist business owners in one form or another. Also, realize that the definition of a \"small-business owner\" encompasses a lot of people, including you!\\n\\nThis means sole proprietors, LLC owners, S corp owner/shareholders, those with employees and those without. Remember, this includes the gig economy, which encompasses everyone from Uber drivers to those selling products on the web as a side hustle.\\n\\nHere are the eight topics you should at least familiarize yourself with when putting together a strategic plan before meeting with your advisors:\\n\\nStimulus Checks Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) SBA Loan Forbearance Increased Access to Retirement Accounts Unemployment Paid Sick Leave Family Medical Leave (FMLA)\\n\\nMost importantly, remember that this law allows you, the business owner, to take advantage of multiple strategies. Don‚Äôt rely on misinformation found on the web telling you what you can and can‚Äôt do. Study this and use it to guide you. Talk to your banker, CPA, attorney or business advisor. You are the captain of your ship!\\n\\nRelated: 3 Financial Steps Small-Business Owners Should Take Right Now\\n\\nTake Advantage of Multiple Strategies\\n\\nDon‚Äôt just hyper focus on the two loans (EIDL and PPP). A wise business owner with different types of operations could find that all eight strategies could help their business, themselves and their family. So, just because you think you are a smaller operation or don‚Äôt have ‚Äúemployees‚Äù that the Paid Sick Leave provision, for example, wouldn‚Äôt apply to you. Wrong.\\n\\nConversely, don‚Äôt think you are too big of a business to consider how you could take advantage of several strategies all at once. Just because you haven‚Äôt laid off employees or closed your doors doesn\\'t mean you can‚Äôt take advantage of the EIDL for a rental property you own, for example.\\n\\nAlso, as I‚Äôve been presenting this lifesaving information to business owners in multiple webinars over the past week, I would refer to eight strategies and bundle the EIDL and PPP into the same benefit. However, I‚Äôve come to realize they are two very different loans and can benefit business owners in different ways. (And yes, you can apply to both the EIDL and PPP. More on that below.) So, let‚Äôs get to it....\\n\\nStimulus Checks: Do I Qualify and When Will I Get Mine?\\n\\nThis is first on my list because the majority of Americans, including you the small-business owner, will be getting one. The payments will be $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for married couples, and for an extra $500 for each child younger than 18. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs when things get complicated.\\n\\nHere‚Äôs who won‚Äôt get a stimulus check:\\n\\nSingle individuals making more than $99,000 (starts phasing out at $75,000).\\n\\nMarried couples making more than $198,000 (starts phasing out at $150,000).\\n\\nChildren who are 18 years old or younger.\\n\\nCollege students between age 18 and 24 that are being claimed as dependents on their parent‚Äôs tax return.\\n\\nNonresident aliens.\\n\\nPeople who haven‚Äôt filed 2018 and 2019 tax returns.\\n\\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on March 30 that they will be deposited into Americans\\'s bank accounts ‚Äúwithin three weeks.\" However, some of you may ask, \"How does the IRS know my bank account?\"\\n\\nIf you gave the IRS your banking information when you filed your 2018 or 2019 tax return, that‚Äôs where they will deposit your check. That method should cover a lot of people. Last year, about 92 million people received refunds via direct deposit. That represents about 82 percent of people who received refunds and nearly 60 percent of all tax filers.\\n\\nIf the IRS doesn‚Äôt have your banking information, they will mail your heck to the address on the tax return. If your address has changed and you have concerns your mail won‚Äôt be forwarded, you can go here to update your address with the IRS. In 2008, when the government distributed similar stimulus money, deposits were made over a three-week period, while paper checks were sent through the mail over 10-week timeframe. According to the legislation, the IRS has until the end of 2020 to transfer the payments.\\n\\nNow, if you haven‚Äôt filed a tax return for 2019 yet, it‚Äôs OK. The IRS will rely on your 2018 forms to get your contact information and look at your adjusted gross oncome to see if you qualify. However, if you haven‚Äôt filed for either 2018 or 2019, file at least a simple return immediately. This will qualify you to receive the stimulus.\\n\\nIf you are on Social Security and haven‚Äôt filed a tax return for a few years (because you weren‚Äôt required to), the Treasury Department said late Wednesday that you will not be required to file a \"simple tax return\" to receive a stimulus check. The government already knows who you are and will send you the check.\\n\\nWith all of that said, here‚Äôs the buzzkill: This isn‚Äôt \"free money.\" It\\'s essentially an advance on your tax refund for 2020. Otherwise stated, it‚Äôs an advance tax credit you‚Äôll see on your tax return when you file next spring.\\n\\nThe Takeaway: Make sure your address is up to date with the IRS, you have filed a 2018 or 2019 return, and if you haven‚Äôt been claiming your children over age 18 on your return previously, have them file a simple return immediately for 2019.\\n\\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs)\\n\\nSome of you may want to run straight to the PPP, in which loans can be forgiven. Don‚Äôt! You can also obtain the EIDL loan and use it for a different purpose. I am talking about this loan before describing the PPP for several reasons. First, you can apply online immediately without having to talk with a banker, and second, you can receive up to $10,000 much more quickly and also get this amount forgiven. Here are the details....\\n\\nThese types of loans have been around a long time and used in the past by those whose businesses were harmed by a natural disaster. Since President Trump essentially designated the entire country as a disaster area, these loans fall under the CARES Act and are now available to all business owners. They were also enhanced with an immediate relief check of $10,000 (for those that make too much to get the stimulus check, this is your chance to cash in and get some help for your business).\\n\\nThe SBA has historically offered many favorable terms in their EIDLs:\\n\\nLoans are up to $2M.\\n\\nThe term is 30 years.\\n\\nInterest Rates are 3.75 percent for small business and (2.75 percent for nonprofits).\\n\\nThe first month‚Äôs payments are deferred a full year from the date of the promissory note.\\n\\nNow under the CARES Act, the EIDLs expanded provisions also include the following:\\n\\nEIDLS can be approved by the SBA based solely on an applicant‚Äôs credit score (not repayment ability and no tax return is required). The government specified that a prior bankruptcy does not disqualify you.\\n\\nEIDLS smaller than $200,000 can be approved without a personal guarantee, no real estate as collateral, and will take a general security interest in business property.\\n\\nIt expands access to sole proprietors or independent contractors and all nonprofits, including 501(c)(6)s.\\n\\nThe $10,000 emergency cash grants are most interesting piece of the legislation. Borrowers can receive $10,000 in an emergency grant cash advance that can be forgiven if spent on paid leave, maintaining payroll, increased costs due to supply chain disruption, mortgage or lease payments or repaying obligations that cannot be met due to revenue loss.\\n\\nMoreover, applicants can get the emergency cash even if they don‚Äôt qualify for additional funds. Because lending decisions are based on self-certification and the applicant‚Äôs credit score, the review process is meant to proceed quickly. CARES also waives the requirement that you be unable to obtain credit elsewhere. That means you can apply even if you already have a credit line.\\n\\nYou can start immediately and apply for these loans directly through the SBA at www.SBA.gov/disaster. There is no need to make an appointment with a banker to start the loan process.\\n\\nAlso, as I stated above, you can actually apply for both the EIDL and PPP loans. Don‚Äôt listen to someone who says you can‚Äôt. The reason why there is confusion is that there is one particular restriction: The disclosure comes on the PPP application. It asks if you have received EIDL funds. Guidance in the Act says you have to disclose if you applied, but bankers aren\\'t currently asking, and the current app doesn\\'t ask this either (which will probably be updated). For now, I suggest you follow the written word and whatever is on the app. You have to sign and certify the information is correct on the app, and lying would be bank fraud. Don\\'t lie! From a strategic point of view, apply for the PPP first, then the EIDL if you\\'re concerned or the app is updated.\\n\\nIf you apply for both and the bank flags as such, it\\'s not the end of the world. The PPP amount would simply be reduced by the $10,000 emergency funds, but you can still obtain the long-term EIDL funds that aren\\'t forgiven.\\n\\nThe other restriction is that if you want to receive \"debt forgiveness\" for the $10,000 EIDL money, or any funds you receive under the PPP, the monies can‚Äôt be used or counted for both loans. For example, if you use the PPP for payroll expenses during the appropriate time and receive debt forgiveness, you can‚Äôt use the same payroll expenses to obtain forgiveness of the $10,000. However, you could use the EIDL money for other things like rent and get the $10,000 forgiveness with a different expense, or use the money for payroll after the PPP time period.\\n\\nFinally, let\\'s be honest ‚Äî this is not a loan for you to start a new business. You have to have been in business by January 31, 2020 to qualify. This is to build or save your business after the damages from the coronavirus, which you will have to explain in order to get this loan. Most importantly, this is a loan that you will have to pay back. If your business was already on life-support before COVID-19, maybe it‚Äôs time to reconsider your future plans rather than go into more debt.\\n\\nThe Takeaway: File immediately for the EIDL $10,000 emergency funds and continue providing/uploading information to even get a bigger loan if necessary. You can always pull out of the process if you decide later you don‚Äôt need the money. Plan to use these funds for things other than the PPP (if you are applying there as well), but in the meantime get rolling so you don‚Äôt miss out on the loan if you need it.\\n\\nPaycheck Protection Program (PPP)\\n\\nThis loan is simply historic. It‚Äôs an amazing opportunity for a small-business owner to get a loan to help cover payroll costs (and a few other costs as well), with the potential of having it completely forgiven and never requiring a dime be paid back.\\n\\nIn order to qualify, a business must have fewer than 500 employees, show that it was in business on or before February 15, 2020 and can certify that the business has been economically affected by the coronavirus, or even that economic uncertainty makes the loan necessary.\\n\\nThe loan is up to $10 million, but the amount each business gets is based on its payroll costs. The amount you qualify for is based on 2.5 times your average monthly payroll costs. Your monthly average payroll is calculated based on your prior 12 months of payroll. Take the average monthly payroll number and multiply it by 2.5. For example, if your monthly average payroll was $20,000, then you would qualify for a $50,000 PPP loan.\\n\\nThe true beauty of this loan is that if you use the money for payroll, rent, mortgage obligations, utilities and other fixed-debt obligations in the first eight weeks after the loan funds, the debt is completely forgiven! However, if the number of full-time employees is reduced over this time period or if your payroll costs are reduced 25 percent or more, then the amount of the loan eligible for forgiveness will be reduced.\\n\\nWhatever funds you don‚Äôt get forgiven convert to a two-year loan that is nearly interest-free. The bill allowed for a maximum rate of 4 percent, but the guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury is stating that the maximum rate would be 0.5 percent.\\n\\nTo obtain this incredible PPP loan, a business owner must apply through an SBA loan officer at a bank. A sample of the loan application has been released by the SBA, but you‚Äôll be getting a loan package from your banker that you‚Äôll be going through with the bank. The bank that grants the loan will determine the loan-forgiveness amount based on the criteria above. The business will request forgiveness of the loan with evidence to the bank, and the bank will have 60 days to approve or deny the forgiveness.\\n\\nAs I stated above, but it\\'s worth saying again, you can actually apply for both the EIDL and PPP loans. Don‚Äôt listen to someone who says you can‚Äôt. The reason why there is confusion is due to one important disclosure and one particular restriction. The disclosure comes on the PPP application. It asks if you have received EIDL funds. Guidance in the Act says you have to disclose if you applied, but bankers aren\\'t currently asking, and the current app doesn\\'t ask this either (which will probably be updated). For now, I suggest you follow the written word and whatever is on the app. You have to sign and certify the information is correct on the app, and lying would be bank fraud. Don\\'t lie! From a strategic point of view, apply for the PPP first, then the EIDL if you\\'re concerned or the app is updated.\\n\\nIf you apply for both and the bank flags as such, it\\'s not the end of the world. The PPP amount would simply be reduced by the $10,000 emergency funds, but you can still obtain the long-term EIDL funds that aren\\'t forgiven.\\n\\nThe other restriction is that if you want to receive debt forgiveness for the $10,000 EIDL money or any funds you receive under the PPP, the monies can‚Äôt be used or counted for both loans. For example, if you use the PPP for payroll expenses during the appropriate time and receive debt forgiveness, you can‚Äôt use the same payroll expenses to obtain forgiveness of the $10,000. However, you could use the EIDL money for other things like rent and get the $10,000 forgiveness with a different expense or use the money for payroll after the PPP time period.\\n\\nThe Takeaway: Determine if the PPP works for your business, and do so by calculating the numbers on your payroll for the past 12 months. If it looks like the program could work for you, immediately contact an SBA-qualified loan officer at a bank and get the application process started. Get in line as soon as you can if you are seeking this loan.\\n\\nSBA Loan Forbearance\\n\\nSome of you may already have one or more SBA loans in your business that you used for equipment, expansion or even real estate, including your own building. If this happens to be a SBA 7(a), 504 or Micro loan, the CARES Act requires the Government to automatically make the payments for you over the next six-month period beginning April 1, 2020.\\n\\nI use the word forbearance because it‚Äôs a unique program and not simply a payment holiday. The government will literally cover payments, including principal and interest, for the next six months. At the end of that time, your mortgage balance will be reduced, your credit will not be affected, you don‚Äôt have to claim the payments made on your behalf as income, and you are back to your regular payment cycle.\\n\\nIn fact, in my own particular situation (I have an SBA 504 loan), my lender sent me an email that I didn‚Äôt even have to apply for the benefit. It was automatic!\\n\\nThe Takeaway: Now, I‚Äôm not suggesting you wait and hope your bank does this for you. If you haven‚Äôt heard from your loan serving agent or bank, and you have the proper SBA loan that qualifies, reach out to everyone involved and make sure this happens.\\n\\nIncreased Access to Retirement Accounts\\n\\nThis is a great strategy in the short run to access cash while you wait for other benefits, but not a good strategy in the long run. Tapping into your retirement accounts, or some might say \"raiding\" your future savings and retirement, is a very dangerous proposition.\\n\\nIf you asked me whether it was a good idea for you, you\\'d better sell me on one of two points: 1. You are going to use the money in the short run and pay it back through your EIDL or PPP loans, or 2. Your business is so amazing that this loan is a no-brainer. If not, I would think twice or three times before you touch that sacred money.\\n\\nNow, assuming you need to use your retirement money, the new CARES Act gave some wonderful benefits and perks on how to access it:\\n\\nIncreased loan provisions for 401k. First, the new law increases the dollar amount you can loan yourself from your own 401(k) from $50,000 to $100,000. Historically, it‚Äôs been 50 percent of your account value, or $50,000, whichever is less. There are no taxes or penalties owned when you take the loan, and so long as you pay the loan back, it\\'s a tax- and penalty-free opportunity to access your own retirement savings early. You have five years to pay back the 401(k) loan, and it must be paid back in substantially level payments, at least quarterly, within five years. A lump-sum payment at the end of the loan is not acceptable. The interest rate for 401(k) loans is currently 5.25 percent. By law, the interest rate to be charged is a ‚Äúcommercially reasonable‚Äù rate. This has been interpreted by the industry and the IRS/DOL to be prime plus 2 percent (prime is currently 3.25 percent).\\n\\nFirst, the new law increases the dollar amount you can loan yourself from your own 401(k) from $50,000 to $100,000. Historically, it‚Äôs been 50 percent of your account value, or $50,000, whichever is less. There are no taxes or penalties owned when you take the loan, and so long as you pay the loan back, it\\'s a tax- and penalty-free opportunity to access your own retirement savings early.

By law, the interest rate to be charged is a ‚Äúcommercially reasonable‚Äù rate. This has been interpreted by the industry and the IRS/DOL to be prime plus 2 percent (prime is currently 3.25 percent). Penalty-free distributions from any retirement account. Next, the new law also creates a penalty-free early distribution rule whereby taxpayers under age 59-and-a-half can take a penalty-free account distribution from their retirement account of up to $100,000. This includes IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, 401(k)s, pension plans, 457 plans and 403(b) plans. The 10 percent early withdrawal penalty is waived, but you are taxed on traditional funds distributed. However, the special distribution provision allows you to pay back the retirement account over a three-year period. You can make multiple payments back to the account or one lump-sum payment to the account by the end of the three-year window. This is an excellent option, as it allows those who can get back on their feet financially to return the funds to their retirement account. And if you do, you‚Äôll avoid any taxes on the distribution. The penalty-free distribution option is available on qualifying distributions made from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.\\n\\nThe Takeaway: Review all of your account balances in your retirement accounts and decide if you really need the cash and if it‚Äôs worth it to access these accounts. If so, get in touch with your account custodian, broker or administrator as quickly as you can to get the process started.\\n\\nUnemployment Benefits for the Self-Employed\\n\\nKeep in mind, this isn‚Äôt just about unemployment for your rank-and-file employees. Have you employed your spouse or children in the past? Are they still working for you in this COVID-19 lockdown? Should you claim unemployment rather than pursue the PPP loan? There are a lot of options you may haven‚Äôt thought about.\\n\\nAlso, what was so shocking about this new legislation was that for the first time in history, the government was providing federal unemployment benefits for the self-employed, something unheard of in the past. Also, the new law expands unemployment benefits, with an additional federal benefit on top of the normal state benefits.\\n\\nUnder the new law, state unemployment benefits have been expanded by an additional 13 weeks, for a total of 39 weeks. Regular state unemployment eligibility is typically 26 weeks. Benefits can range from $200-$550 a week, depending on the State.\\n\\nNext, the federal government is giving out $600 a week, in addition to the state benefit. But in order to get the federal benefit, you first must be approved for state unemployment.\\n\\nAs a strategic example, a business owner may terminate a family member that‚Äôs been legitimately on the payroll so they can claim unemployment, apply for the PPP loan for their own payroll (which is forgiven), apply for the EIDL for the immediate $10,000 (which can also be forgiven), and then before they terminate the family member, give them paid sick leave for two weeks (see below). This is the power of a coordinated strategy.\\n\\nRelated: Innovation Prevails During Times of Crisis\\n\\nSo, if you are going to pursue unemployment benefits, I wanted to set forth some basic steps. Please know that these can vary depending on your situation and the state you live in, but they are certainly a great place to start:\\n\\nIf you have rank-and-file employees you had to furlough or terminate, it‚Äôs up to them to claim unemployment, which they probably will. Did you have any family members on your payroll (W-2), not 1099 subs, over the past year? If yes, we want to determine if it‚Äôs best to keep them on payroll or let them claim unemployment.\\n\\nIf we decide to claim unemployment, we‚Äôll go to Step 4. Are you as the business owner completely stepping away from the business and have no other sources of earned income? Meaning the business is not making a profit, or you are completely shutting it down? If yes, then move onto Step 4. Research your state requirements for qualifying for employment. This means determining the base period for which an employee must have worked, how much they received and what the benefits would be. Decide if it‚Äôs worth applying. Get your application in for state unemployment. This is required. In order to get the federal \"kicker\" of $600 a week, you first must be approved for state unemployment and receive that benefit as stated above.\\n\\nIndividuals who haven‚Äôt been laid off or can‚Äôt work due to a variety of reasons related to the coronavirus would also be eligible for unemployment checks. These reasons would include a case where they were diagnosed with coronavirus, were awaiting a diagnosis or had a family member diagnosed with the disease. Individuals who were scheduled to start a job and could not because their future workplaces had been shut down due to the coronavirus would also be eligible. Finally, individuals whose head of household died directly due to coronavirus would be eligible.\\n\\nThe Takeaway: Start with Steps 1 and 2 above and see if unemployment benefits could work for your small business and family circle.\\n\\nEmergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL)\\n\\nWhen President Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the new law now required certain employers to provide EPSL in certain circumstances. It takes effect on April 2, 2020 and will expire on December 31, 2020.\\n\\nThis is an unheard-of law that‚Äôs never been on the books before. Essentially, qualifying employees (see the six reasons below) can receive paid leave for up to two weeks in advance (while not working), and the federal government will pay for it.\\n\\nOnly employers with fewer than 500 employees, including public agencies, are required to provide the EPSL benefit. The law also allows for subsequent Department of Labor regulations to exempt small businesses with fewer than 50 employees if applying these provisions would jeopardize the viability of the business.\\n\\nKeep in mind, the EPSL doesn‚Äôt cost employers anything! Once benefits are paid, employers simply apply for a full 100 percent reimbursement and receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit against any payroll taxes paid with their quarterly payroll reports.\\n\\nIf employees qualify under 1 of these six reasons (see below), they can receive benefits in the following amounts:\\n\\nTwo weeks (80 hours) of pay, immediately (not after they come back) paid at their regular rate of pay, for reasons 1-3 below (employee is sick with COVID-19). This is at a maximum of $511 a day and $5,110 in total. Two weeks (80 hours) of pay, immediately (again, not after they come back to work) paid at 2/3 their regular rate of pay, for reasons 4-6 below (caregiver reasons). This is at a maximum of $200 a day and $2,000 in total.\\n\\nIn order to qualify, employees must show the inability to work or telework due to any of the following:\\n\\nThe employee is subject to a federal, state or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19. The employee has been advised by a healthcare provider to self-quarantine because of COVID-19. The employee is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and is seeking a medical diagnosis. The employee is caring for an individual (not limited to a family member) subject to a quarantine or isolation order or advised to quarantine or isolation. The employee is caring for a son or daughter whose school or place of care is closed or childcare provider is unavailable, due to COVID-19 precautions. The employee is experiencing any other substantially similar conditions as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor (a catch-all!).\\n\\nIncredibly, the sick-leave provision applies to all employees, regardless of length of service.\\n\\nThe Takeaway: If you have a spouse or family member on the payroll, and they qualify under one of the above six reasons, they could receive two weeks pay, and all it costs you is the employment taxes. That‚Äôs close to $5,000 of free money. Just remember to be honest and keep good records if you make the claim.\\n\\nFamily Medical Leave (FMLA)\\n\\nThe new CARES Act also dramatically expands the FMLA. This portion of the law was passed to give employees compensation and the necessary time to take care of a family member effected by the virus. It also takes effect on April 2, 2020 and will expire on December 31, 2020.\\n\\nEssentially, if an employee qualifies, it allows the employee up to 12 weeks of paid leave, and the employer is reimbursed up to certain limits and amounts.\\n\\nAgain, not all companies will participate, as this law only applies to employers with fewer than 500 employees, including public agencies. However, employers of an employee who is a healthcare provider or an emergency responder can elect to exclude the employee from this FMLA provision. The law also allows for subsequent Department of Labor regulations to exempt small businesses with fewer than 50 employees if applying these provisions would jeopardize the viability of the business.\\n\\nThis is limited to an employee who cannot work or telework due to the need to care for the employee‚Äôs minor son or daughter if the minor child‚Äôs school or place of childcare has been closed, or the childcare provider is unavailable due to a ‚Äúpublic health emergency‚Äù with respect to COVID-19 declared by a federal, state or local authority. Basically, it is ‚Äúcaregiver leave.‚Äù\\n\\nUnlike Emergency Paid Sick Leave, under the FMLA provision, only full- and part-time employees who have been on the employer‚Äôs payroll for 30 days are eligible.\\n\\nThe first 10 days (two weeks) are unpaid, but an employee can substitute accrued paid leave, including the new EPSL. The remaining leave (a maximum of 10 weeks, as the total available is still 12 weeks) is paid at 2/3 of the employee‚Äôs regular rate, for the number of hours the employee would be otherwise scheduled to work. This pay is capped at $200 a day and $10,000 total.\\n\\nFinally, under the expanded FMLA provision, the employee must be restored to the same or equivalent position. However, there is an exception for employers with fewer than 25 employees, if the employee‚Äôs position no longer exists due to operational changes related to the public-health emergency, such as a reduction in force or restructuring because of a downturn in business. Essentially, an employer cannot retaliate against an employee for exercising his or her rights under these new laws. You will also have to post a notice detailing these laws, and the Department of Labor is in the process of drafting that Notice.\\n\\nThe Takeaway: If you have had a spouse or family member on the payroll for at least 30 days, and they qualify for paid FMLA, this could be another perfect fit for your business while you as the business owner continue to get paid under the PPP.\\n\\nIn summary, please realize that changes are happening daily as we all navigate rough waters, and we are doing our best to keep our clients, and even non-clients, up-to-date by publishing more videos, podcasts and articles. We pray your family will be blessed with health safety and success. Hang on!\\n\\nThis post will be updated as more details about the tax relief guidelines are released.\\n\\nMark J.

We also work extensively with sourcing networks and are in the process of launching a luxury sneaker brand called NERA.\\n\\nI was one of the early alarmists among my co-workers and friends when COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan. I was aware of how lucky we were to have avoided a total SARS outbreak back in 2002.\\n\\nThe writing was on the wall....\\n\\nHowever, this didn‚Äôt keep me from traveling to Ukraine and Italy in February, as COVID-19 still seemed to be isolated to China. I shot an ad campaign at our shoe factory in Italy and finalized our production run. After that trip, however, the virus quickly escalated. Italy saw a tremendous spike in cases just four days after we had departed.\\n\\nNow Italy has been under total lockdown for weeks, our factory has shut down and the United States is racking up cases at an alarming rate ‚Äî particularly in my home state of New York. I have seen businesses I work with go from doing well to rethinking their entire operation, while others have gone from good to great.\\n\\nRelated: Free Webinar ‚Äî Coronavirus Emergency Loans for Small Businesses\\n\\nConsumer sentiments have changed drastically. Luxury-goods clients have slashed creative budgets. Layoffs have begun. A lot of people have asked me how bad this is going to get. There are a couple things we must remember moving forward.\\n\\nNice-to-have products must adapt to survive\\n\\nIn economic downturns, consumer demand for ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù products goes down as buyers focus on their more basic needs. Health, wellness and safety ‚Äî products that fit into the lower parts of Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs ‚Äî become the top priority.\\n\\nFor venture-backed and bootstrapped startups either pre-launch or in their initial stages, the coronavirus situation may necessitate a shift in strategy. Strands Hair Care, a direct-to-consumer custom shampoo and conditioner brand backed by data, is one example of a startup that is adapting to changing consumer preferences.\\n\\nEric Delapenha, the company‚Äôs founder and CEO, explained to me during a recent phone call that he has been very cautious with the coronavirus situation: ‚ÄúThe way we position Strands will be paramount if we are going to go through with this. If we shut everything down right now, it would be a travesty.‚Äù\\n\\nThe crisis has prompted them to highlight specific aspects of the brand that are relevant to new consumer norms, and they\\'ve begun to test ads that focus more on the consumer and their need for self-care from the comfort of their home.\\n\\n‚ÄúOur customers still want to look and feel good,\" says Delapenha. \"Our messaging has not changed that much; we‚Äôre just highlighting different needs. We‚Äôre focusing on how to do that now.‚Äù\\n\\nOverseas supply chains are bound for disruption\\n\\nThe World Health Organization has confirmed COVID-19 cases in almost every country. If you source products from particularly hard-hit areas, expect delays or timeline changes associated with producing or shipping as the situation evolves, if this has not already been the case.\\n\\nSome factories will try to stay open. Despite the government-mandated, non-essential-labor shutdown in Italy, many factories (including our own) remained open through late March until the country finally closed them down. This will likely start occurring in other parts of the world.\\n\\nFactories that insist on staying open will still experience issues. Facilities that insist on taking orders may not be able to fulfill orders and instead may be relying on immediate cash flow to hold them over.\\n\\nA factory can‚Äôt move into production if virtually all of their raw material suppliers are shut down. Delays are inevitable, and as a small business, it‚Äôs important to predict these issues and make an informed decision.\\n\\nUnfortunately, smaller businesses will most certainly be placed behind larger corporations for order fulfillment when production ramps up again. At our factory in Italy, which produces for some of the most notable European fashion houses, we will be considered lower priority in terms of production, potentially causing further delays.\\n\\nIn times like these, production diversification has distinct advantages. For those that have not already diversified, it‚Äôll be important to prepare for when things do get back to normal.\\n\\nCreate new opportunities in select markets, and diversify production\\n\\nCOVID-19 has resulted in accelerated customer acquisition as market conditions favor certain brands. For instance, there has been a significant uptick in cannabis sales, as California labeled cannabis companies ‚Äúessential businesses‚Äù for their health benefits. In this case, self-quarantine causes customers stuck at home to try new products, especially those with positive mind and body attributes.\\n\\nMichael Kamins, a partner at OpenNest and the founder of Humakina, expressed to me how even a positive market impact necessitates a heightened sense of preparedness for pre-launch brands: ‚ÄúWe have been adapting our launch strategy for a COVID world. There have been no holdups in our supply chain thus far, and we feel very fortunate for this. But we understand that the rapidly evolving developments might cause negative impacts on supply chains at any time. We are continuously monitoring the situation, assessing the impacts and preparing actions to respond.‚Äù\\n\\nA fairly diversified supply chain also helped Humakina. When critical suppliers in China shut down, U.S.-based operations continued. Open communication with multiple stateside suppliers helps them prepare for additional shutdowns, a practice other businesses should emulate coming out of this crisis.\\n\\nRelated: Inside the DIY Movement to Make Face Shields and Masks for Healthcare Workers\\n\\nNow‚Äôs the time to move forward with confidence\\n\\nThings will eventually go back to normal as infection rates decrease, markets rebound and people go back to work.

In the interim, brands that don‚Äôt fit into those immediate needs discussed above may need to alter the way they communicate value propositions to their customers and look for opportunities to capitalize on changing consumer preferences.\\n\\nThere is a lot of uncertainty right now for small businesses, but with that, there is tremendous opportunity.

Make Sure You Understand Digital ADA Compliance', 'text': \"Any business's online presence must comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.\\n\\nApril 3, 2020 5 min read\\n\\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\\n\\nAs the old cliche goes, ‚ÄúPresentation is everything.‚Äù Having great content for your website is an important starting point, but ensuring that it is presented in an appealing way will make all the difference in whether visitors stick around. Unfortunately, far too many companies and brands ignore the needs of users with disabilities when implementing a design update or launching a brand new site. And this can prove costly, as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is increasingly being viewed as applicable to websites and mobile apps.\\n\\nThe result? Celebrities like Beyonc√© and major corporations like Domino‚Äôs are getting sued when disabled users find themselves unable to fully use their websites. Domino‚Äôs especially has faced negative press.\\n\\nEven without lawsuits, failure to make web accessibility a priority could result in significant losses for your business. The 2019 Click-Away Pound Survey found that 69 percent of individuals with disabilities ‚Äú‚Äòclick away from a site with [access] barriers.‚Äù Despite this, only 8 percent contact site owners about their problems. This means a non-ADA compliant site could be losing money without your even knowing it. As such, few things are more important than making sure you address the needs of those with visual, auditory, mobility and other disabilities.\\n\\nStart With the Basics\\n\\nAn analysis of 10,000,000 web pages conducted by accessiBe revealed that the vast majority of compliance issues occur with seemingly basic elements of web design. An incredible 98 percent of websites had noncompliant menus, and 83 percent failed to utilize accessible buttons, while 89 percent had noncompliant popups.\\n\\nWhere did the accessibility problems stem from? In the majority of cases, noncompliance issues came from a failure to offer alternative methods of navigating through these common design elements.\\n\\nAs just one example, sites should offer the ability to navigate the menu bar with keyboard arrows, open dropdown functions with the enter key and move to the next element with the tab key. A failure to implement all of these features could cause a motor-impaired user to waste several minutes.\\n\\nA related problem is when content or actions are subjected to a timer, an especially common issue during the checkout process. Giving users an option to turn off, extend or adjust timers will ensure that they aren‚Äôt kicked out of a session before they can finish their purchase.\\n\\nSuch navigation issues can get even harder with popups. If a user can‚Äôt close the popup by pressing the escape key, they may not be able to close out of it at all. From voice-friendly search to keyboard-only navigation, you must consider alternative methods.\\n\\nRelated: 5 Steps to Make Sure Your Website Is ADA-Compliant\\n\\nProvide Alternative Content-Delivery Methods\\n\\nAnother common web-compliance issue comes with the delivery of your content. Do your images have alt text so someone using a screen reader can still get the information conveyed by the picture? Are there text transcripts for video-only or audio-only content? Do your videos provide closed captioning?\\n\\nAs your website expands the type of content it offers in an effort to grow its audience, you will need to ensure that each new piece of content is accessible to all. And this likely won‚Äôt be as time-consuming as you might think. For example, if your website is publishing an infographic, ADA compliance would entail supplying the full copy of the infographic in a text format below the image. As part of the process of creating the infographic, the text would likely already have been produced in a standalone format, so all you need to do is add this to the bottom of the page.\\n\\nPresentation Matters\\n\\nADA-compliant presentation goes beyond making sure that each section of the site uses proper HTML or tagging. Remember, not everyone that could have trouble reading your web content will be using a screen reader.\\n\\nFor example, there must be adequate color contrast between the site‚Äôs text and background. Color alone is not enough to convey information. Font should be in an easy-to-read text that is still legible when users zoom in. Web pages should avoid series of flashes that could trigger a seizure or other severe physical reaction.\\n\\nThe overall site layout ‚Äî especially navigational elements ‚Äî should stay the same no matter what page someone visits on. Form fields should always be clearly labeled so users know what information is required. A cohesive, well-designed site will benefit everyone who visits your page ‚Äî not just those with disabilities.\\n\\nRelated: Even Internet Entrepreneurs Need to Make Their Businesses Handicap Accessible\\n\\nDon‚Äôt Make ADA Compliance an Afterthought\\n\\nThis is just a quick overview, and I strongly recommend reading the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines from the Web Accessibility Initiative for a full understanding of how to improve your site.\\n\\nWhile the way the ADA is being enforced in the digital world is still subject to debate, site owners should prioritize making it a key part of their design from the get-go.

Here\\'s how to not be one of them.\\n\\nApril 3, 2020 5 min read\\n\\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\\n\\nThe way people interact with your emails tells you everything about your marketing strategy. Are you sending valuable content? You‚Äôll see the feedback reflected in your open and click rates. Is your email list accurate? Your bounce rates, spam complaints and other metrics will show you. If those numbers aren‚Äôt making you happy, it‚Äôs in your power to improve them.\\n\\nTo see where you stand, let‚Äôs take a look at industry benchmarks. These vary depending on the source, so it‚Äôs difficult to establish what the most precise data is. Dave Chaffey of Smart Insights published an in-depth study on the topic, gathering information from several email-service providers. Here‚Äôs what he found after analyzing hundreds of millions of sends:\\n\\nThe average open rate, across all industries, varies from 14.79 percent (Constant Contact) to 21.33 percent (MailChimp).\\n\\nThe average click-through rate ranges between 2.98 percent (Get Response) to 6.99 percent (Constant Contact).\\n\\nThere‚Äôs a significant difference between these numbers, but they should give you some perspective on how your own emails are performing. What can you do if your metrics are below these benchmarks, or if you want your email marketing to be even more effective? The below tactics will help you do just that.\\n\\nRelated: 5 Tips for Better Email Marketing Performance\\n\\n1. Scrub your email lists.\\n\\nHaving had the chance to see firsthand how much list-cleaning helps, I can tell you that it‚Äôs a great place to start boosting your email engagement. We‚Äôve had customers come to us with a 20 percent bounce rate, and after they validated their list, that rate went down to less than 1 percent.\\n\\nNick Dimitriou, the head of growth at email-marketing service Moosend, confirms how important email hygiene is. ‚ÄúWhile content and volume greatly influence your email deliverability,‚Äù Dimitriou told me, ‚Äúthe quality of your mailing list also has an impact. To increase engagement, verify whether your contacts are valid and deliverable, and do it regularly.‚Äù\\n\\nSo how exactly do you go about checking the quality of your list? ‚ÄúUsing a good email validation system helps you remove bad contacts from your list and boosts your overall performance,\" Dimitriou added. \"This way, you avoid the risk of being filtered out by mailbox providers, and you have peace of mind knowing you communicate with real people.\"\\n\\nRelated: 5 Automated Email-Marketing Messages You Should Be Using\\n\\n2. Test your content for what works best.\\n\\nOnce you know your list is in good shape, it‚Äôs time to take a closer look at your content. Start by analyzing your metrics from the past six months. What type of emails got the highest engagement?\\n\\nA few aspects to focus on:\\n\\nWhat responses did you get on transactional emails versus marketing offers versus newsletters?\\n\\nOut of your offers and newsletters, which emails tended to have the highest open and click rates?\\n\\nDoes your audience prefer short messages, or is it more inclined to read longer emails?\\n\\nWhich worked better: plain-text or HTML?\\n\\nIt‚Äôs essential to compare your emails against each other before you start tweaking for better results. Everything can be adjusted, but first, pay attention to what your subscribers like so you can give them more of that.\\n\\nWhen it comes to writing, there are plenty of tactics that boost engagement. In a recent interview with Zero Bounce, copywriter Laura Belgray advised: ‚ÄúWrite conversationally, as if you‚Äôre writing to one friend ‚Äî not formally, to a group. Put effort into the subject line, making it intriguing and also informal, as it‚Äôs from a friend.‚Äù\\n\\nAccording to research from Business2Community, 47 percent of people decide whether to open an email just by scanning the subject line. Try Belgray‚Äôs suggestions next time you write yours.\\n\\n3. Score your contacts to identify the ones most likely to engage.\\n\\nList hygiene and content play an essential role in your inbox placement and engagement rates, but what if you‚Äôve validated your list and improved your content, and you still can‚Äôt seem to get better responses? You could take things a step further and try an email-scoring service. The process is similar to cleaning your list, but you get more in-depth data.\\n\\nAn email-scoring system examines every email address in your database and assigns a score to each. Based on the activity levels it detects, the system predicts how likely a certain email user is to engage with your messages. A low score indicates the address is inactive and thus unlikely to react. The higher the score, the more you can focus on those contacts and re-engage them with targeted campaigns.\\n\\nEmail scoring helps you learn more about your subscribers‚Äôs behavior before you even email them.

But it can also be viewed as an opportunity to build influence with your network. If leveraged properly, your authority, or social proof, can act as a lifeline for your business ‚Äî even during the most precarious circumstances. Here are five strategies you can activate today to extend its impact and hopefully help ease the quarantine blues.\\n\\n1. Tell engaging stories to your followers.\\n\\nNow is the perfect time to deviate from the norm. Yes, business is always in session, and your following looks to you for the best tips and tricks to grow their business. However, consider the environment. People are looking for ways to escape the frenzy. They are looking for ways to learn, earn and laugh.\\n\\nShow your humanity, and share how you are navigating this time. Have a funny family story? Share it. Is homeschooling your children for the first time proving to be not so simple? Share it. You never know who your content will reach. Your potential customer or client may choose to do business with you because you decided to share.\\n\\nRelated: Facebook and Instagram to Limit Coronavirus Misinformation\\n\\n2. Engage influencers with a call to action.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt be afraid to leverage the platforms of industry influencers to help solidify your own. Many times, the content you put out may not get the response you desire because the call to action is unclear.\\n\\nChoose five engaged influencers who you know will want to engage with your content, and tag them on your posts or videos. Ask them if they agree or disagree with your content and to tell you why. You may even ask them to add another useful point to your content to offer bigger and better value. When they do decide to like, comment or share your content, their actions increase the likelihood of more viewers seeing your stuff.\\n\\nAssociation is key when it comes to building your social proof. Your credibility is automatically heightened when you can pair your brand with one that's more familiar to the public.\\n\\n3. Network via social media.\\n\\nNow is the time to respond to all those ignored inbox messages and comments under your posts. When it comes to engaging and influencing others to connect with your brand, showing that you care by liking a comment or responding to a comment can hold its weight in gold. You (or someone on your team) should never be too busy to connect with those people who keep you in business. When someone tags you or your company in a post, especially if they have purchased from you, help boost your likeability by thanking them. Loyal customers are created one comment at a time.\\n\\nAlso consider having a virtual coffee session with someone who has been vying for your time. The fact that you took time out of your day, especially in a time like this, to connect with a fan, follower or colleague can yield a return more significant than you'd expect.\\n\\n4. Offer perks in exchange for purchaser testimonials.\\n\\nThe biggest and best form of social proof building is word of mouth. Contrary to what society may suggest, people love good news. Buyer decisions are influenced by what they read from others outside of the company who have something positive (or negative) to say. Yelp and Google reviews, Amazon and company-centric ratings help influence who buys and who keeps their money in their pockets. Offer an incentive for your buyers to leave a review. Written testimonials are great, but video is better, since it allows the viewers to catch the emotion of the purchaser, delivering a bit more realness.\\n\\nRelated: The Coronavirus Pandemic Versus the Digital Economy\\n\\n5. Boost your own platform, and ask people to be a part.\\n\\nNo matter how large or small you think your platform may be, it is one of your most valuable assets. The truth is that people love being a part of something bigger than themselves. Why not open the door for people to use your platform to fill the void?\\n\\nIf you have a blog and you need more content, ask for guest contributors to submit to help you grow your readership. If you have a podcast and you feel like you need another voice to further the conversation, send out an open call for possible guests. Sharing your platform allows you to tap into a new audience, and your guests can do the same.\\n\\nIf you want to go further than you are right now, engage other people to help you get there.

So what do people mean when they talk about buyer personas?\\n\\nPersonas Are Characters\\n\\nBest-selling authors have nothing on marketers when it comes to creating characters. Buyer personas are fictional people created to represent certain groups of customers that allow companies to get a deeper understanding of the people buying their products. They\\'re commonly used in marketing departments, but they help the entire company. As Raphi Mahgereft, founder and CEO of jewelry retailer Allurez, recently explained via email, \"The key is to understand your customer on a deeper level. For example, we understand that some of our clients want jewelry that‚Äôs sentimental in value and unique to them, so we created customized options. All our choices are based on customer needs.\"\\n\\nRelated: All About Buyer Personas\\n\\nMarket Smarter, Not Harder\\n\\nCreating characters to represent your customers will give you valuable insights about their wants and needs and help you avoid wasting resources on ineffective marketing campaigns and unpopular products.\\n\\nEmail marketing is a valuable tool, but many companies spend massive amounts of time figuring out how to increase open rates. Research shows that using buyer personas to target groups of customers increases open rates by 16 percent.\\n\\nThe reason personas are so effective is they help you see the human side of customers. Too often, businesses develop the bad habit of viewing customers as data points. Unfortunately, it\\'s difficult to connect to a data point.\\n\\nWhen you see customers as the complex humans that they are, its easier to provide them with what they\\'re looking for. After creating buyer personas, Skytap, a cloud-based software company, implemented a content-marketing strategy tailored to specific customers. They were able to increase sales leads by 124 percent, online leads by 97 percent and organic search traffic by 55 percent.\\n\\nBuyer Personas Are Fact-Based\\n\\nThe most important aspect of creating a buyer persona is to base your character on real data. A persona is not useful if it doesn\\'t accurately represent the real people buying your product. Start with describing what you already know about your customer, but be sure to leave out assumptions. Only use details with solid evidence.\\n\\nNext, you\\'ll want to do research to get more data. Your research could be in the form of interviews, observations, surveys or a combination thereof. The more information you collect, the more fully realized your personas will turn out.\\n\\nThe next step is to group your customers. If you\\'re just starting out, choose the largest group to create a persona for. Do parents make up the majority of people buying your product, or is your brand most popular among college students or teenagers?\\n\\nWhichever group you choose to create a persona around, it\\'s important to get specific. If most of your customers are parents, determine what type of parents they are. What do their day-to-day lives look like? What are their hobbies, fears and goals? Details like this could help anticipate aspects of customer behavior.\\n\\nNot All Details Are Relevant\\n\\nAlthough you want a highly detailed profile for your buyer persona, you shouldn\\'t waste time on minutiaie. Adele Revella, CEO of Buyer Persona Institute, recently wrote for Content Marketing Institute, \"Marketers sometimes make the mistake of gathering buyer information that doesn‚Äôt really help them deliver more effective content or campaigns. If you are bogged down with finding just the right stock image of your persona, then you‚Äôre focusing on the wrong things.\"\\n\\nOnce you know which specifics are important, you can write up a profile for your fictional customer that looks a lot like the real ones. Congratulations, you have a buyer persona!\\n\\nRelated: The Science of Building Buyer Personas\\n\\nBeat the Competition\\n\\nAlthough many people have heard of buyer personas, too many businesses don\\'t spend the proper time and energy needed to create them. The businesses that spend the time quickly become customer favorites.\\n\\nBusinesses in the B2B space are especially known to skip the buyer persona process. In fact, only 44 percent of B2B marketers use personas, so you\\'ll be able to shine in comparison when you build detailed and data-driven buyer personas.

Big ones, like running out of cash or running into legal issues, are hard to ignore. But in the midst of the long nights, major decisions and mountains of paperwork, it‚Äôs easy to miss little things that can make a major difference in the long run.\\n\\nKeep an eye out for these missteps as you endeavor on your newest venture.\\n\\n1. Failing to do research\\n\\nA CBInsights study shows that 42 percent of startups fail because they don't address a market need. Tackling a problem that‚Äôs interesting to solve may be fun, but it isn‚Äôt a path to success.\\n\\nBefore you invest in your business idea, ask yourself what problem your service or product is solving. Then, discover through research whether that problem is common enough ‚Äî and painful enough ‚Äî for consumers that it warrants a solution.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt guess; use tools like surveys and focus groups to go directly to customers. Get at least a few dozen responses before making a decision.\\n\\nRelated: How to Find the Holy Grail of Product-Market Fit\\n\\n2. Not setting expectations\\n\\nOnce you've established a product or service, you still have to set customer expectations. Being clear about what you‚Äôre offering and the outcome customers can expect is key.\\n\\nThink through not just the sales process, but also your entire service. If you were to book a TV-installation service, you might expect them to mount the TV, connect all the cables and demonstrate how it works. If the installer only plugged the television in, you‚Äôd be a disappointed customer. Get on the same page with customers before they buy.\\n\\nOn the staff side of things, unclear expectations can cause trouble. To solve this, write detailed job descriptions and review them with your team members. Make sure everyone is on the same page about deliverables and duties.\\n\\n3. Leaving data on the table\\n\\nThe launch of your business is the best time to start collecting data. Recording everything from customers's demographic details to customer-acquisition costs to your inventory depletion rate is essential.\\n\\nDecide on which metrics you want to track. Speak to team members about which numbers they should be monitoring. Ask them to add those figures to your database or spreadsheet.\\n\\nAt least once a month, check in to ensure the data is reasonably clean. Times and dates, for example, should be entered in a consistent format. Missing fields should be kept to a minimum.\\n\\nAfter that, you‚Äôll need to get the data into a database for analysis. Tools known as ‚ÄúETL‚Äù (extract, transform and load) assist or automate the process of capturing your data from various sources and loading it to your data warehouse, in addition to integrating with popular sales, marketing and customer-service tools.\\n\\n4. Overworking\\n\\nTight-knit teams and long hours are part of working at a startup, but at some point, it has to stop. Only leaving the office to stock up on energy drinks isn‚Äôt sustainable.\\n\\nAs an entrepreneur, you set the pace. The rest of your team looks to you to set boundaries. Prevent burnout by establishing a culture of taking breaks, eating well and getting plenty of rest.\\n\\nResearch published in Harvard Business Review found timeboxing to be the most useful of 100 common time-management hacks. Timeboxing entails ‚Äúchunking‚Äù the day into 15- or 30-minute blocks and assigning a specific task to each. And make sure to timebox both your work and personal time. Treat making dinner with your family as time that's just as important as an investor meeting.\\n\\nRelated: How to Keep Up With Customer Expectations\\n\\n5. Under- or overdoing digital marketing\\n\\nDigital marketing is a ‚Äúfine line‚Äù investment. Certainly, you need a website, digital ads and accounts on relevant social media sites. But beware that it‚Äôs easy to overspend, both in terms of time and money, on digital marketing.\\n\\nStart with social media. Trying to have a presence in every space online isn‚Äôt sustainable. Instead, poll your customers and maintain accounts only where necessary. If you sell handmade bows, creating Pinterest and Instagram accounts ‚Äî both image-driven social networks ‚Äî and setting up an Etsy shop is a more strategic way to go.\\n\\nEmail newsletters are another area where companies commonly over- or underdo it. Email marketing can deliver a 38-fold return on investment, but that's only when the email content is educational and cost-effective. Don‚Äôt retain a high-priced marketing agency if you can write the content yourself. Resist the urge to be too promotional.\\n\\nSeeing your business through launch day doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre out of the woods. In fact, your greatest pitfalls lie ahead. Avoid falling into these five, and you‚Äôll be better off than most fledgling entrepreneurs.\", 'author': ['Peter Daisyme']}, {'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/ORsKmCGlxgk/348553', 'published': '2020-04-02T12:00:00', 'title': \"Your Conference May Be Canceled, but Here's How to Host a Digital Webinar Instead\", 'text': \"As everything goes online, turn the videoconferencing revolution into a marketing tool.\\n\\nApril 2, 2020 2 min read\\n\\nDisclosure: Our goal is to feature products and services that we think you'll find interesting and useful.

After years of freelancing on Upwork and now also running my own agency, I\\'m deeply aware of the impact good reviews can have on a business‚Äô success. They can strengthen a freelancer‚Äôs credibility and steer their growth in the right direction.\\n\\nRelated: How is Gig Economy Transforming the Workforce?\\n\\nI\\'ve completed over 100 freelance jobs on Upwork and gotten five-star reviews for nearly all of them. I\\'ve had a handful of less than perfect reviews (I\\'m human, after all) but have never received anything less than four stars. Here are some tips I\\'ve found helpful in ensuring a positive review.\\n\\n1. Be straightforward and open from the beginning\\n\\nNever overpromise. Instead, set realistic expectations of your work and be transparent about pricing, turnaround time and revisions. I usually set a fixed price based on the project so there are no surprises in the end. Clients know exactly what they\\'ll pay from day one. I also provide clients with a clear timeline of my process so they know when to expect first drafts and revisions.\\n\\n2. Present your work in a professional way\\n\\nYou only get one chance to make a first impression. Whether it\\'s showcasing your work in a professional presentation or making sure your copy is proofread (more than once!), demonstrating care and consistency is key. Although a typo isn\\'t a huge deal, frequent errors and careless slipups can diminish the quality of your work.\\n\\nRelated: 8 Ways to Skyrocket Real User Reviews for Your Ecommerce Products\\n\\n3. Communicate\\n\\nIn any partnership, communication is key. I keep clients updated on the status of their projects, alert them to any changes as soon as possible and get back to any questions within one business day. I also ask for feedback after each revision to make sure I\\'m on the same page as my client.\\n\\n4. Guarantee your work\\n\\nOne thing that I think has set me apart on Upwork is my revision process. My mission is to work with clients until they\\'re happy, so I provide as many revisions as needed. I don\\'t rush them or force my ideas on them ‚Äî the final choice is theirs. This may be more time-consuming for me, but it almost guarantees I\\'ll receive a positive review.\\n\\n5. Be comprehensive\\n\\nWhen someone comes to me for branding help, I take a comprehensive approach to their project. If they hire me for a naming project, I\\'ll give them a few options from different angles along with the rationale behind each idea. I specialize in pairing eye-catching names with mind-catching stories designed to create a connection with potential customers. I also do my best to find matching domain names when working on a project so clients don\\'t have to spend extra time and money on a domain name. This is also time-consuming, but it shows clients how invested I am in their projects.\\n\\nRelated: How Online Customer Reviews Help SEO and Drive Sales Growth\\n\\n6. Stay professional\\n\\nNever argue with a client. If they\\'re unhappy with your work, that\\'s OK Try to see things from their perspective, explain the thinking and methodology behind your work and ask for specific direction so you can match their expectations next time. I love the quote \"All of your talent is wasted without good attitude and work ethic.\"\\n\\nHow to address a bad review\\n\\nNo one is immune to bad reviews, even if they follow all the steps I listed above. If I do get one, my first move is to respond to it. A negative review will stay negative forever if it\\'s never addressed, so I quickly craft a response. Typically, I reach out to the client to see if there\\'s anything I can do to fix the situation, and if I can, I do it at no additional charge.\\n\\nHopefully, this will encourage them to update their review. Then other potential Upwork clients will be able to see that I\\'ve successfully addressed and resolved a problem, which adds to my credibility.\\n\\nAfter I submit the last milestone of a project, I make sure to message the client and ask if there\\'s anything else they need help with (part of my satisfaction guarantee!). I also thank them for their business and mention that I\\'m looking forward to receiving their feedback. Upwork prompts them to leave a review when the contract is complete, but this is a good way to remind them if they forget.\\n\\nRelated: 3 Tips for Dealing With Negative Reviews Like a True Entrepreneur', 'author': ['Tatiana Dumitru']}, {'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/U7vskJKWQQY/345904', 'published': '2020-04-01T17:51:00', 'title': '34 Critical Tips for Creating Enewsletters That Get Opened and Read', 'text': 'Learn how to write enewsletters that make prospects reach out for more.\\n\\nApril 1, 2020 7 min read\\n\\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\\n\\nThe following excerpt is from Robert W. Bly‚Äôs The Content Marketing Handbook. Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble\\n\\nWhether you‚Äôre building brand awareness, generating leads or making direct sales, there are two ways to sell your products and services to your enewsletter subscribers. One is to place small online ads in the regular issues. These ads are usually a hundred words or so in length and include a link to a page on your site where the subscriber can read about and order the product. The other is to send stand-alone email messages to your subscribers, again promoting a specific product and a link to your site.\\n\\nMy enewsletter, The Direct Response Letter (www.bly.com/report), is not the most successful or widely read on the planet. But marketing results and comments from subscribers tell me my formula for creating the enewsletter ‚Äî which, including copy and layout, takes me just an hour or two per issue ‚Äî works. I want to share the formula with you, so you can produce an effective enewsletter of your own ‚Äî by yourself, at your computer, in just a single morning or afternoon.\\n\\nWhen reading a free enewsletter (as opposed to one they pay for), people spend just a little time on it before deleting it. Therefore, I use a quick-reading format designed to allow subscribers to read it online as soon as they open it.\\n\\nIn this format, my enewsletter always has five to seven short articles, each just a few paragraphs long. Every article can be read in less than a minute, so it never takes more than seven minutes to read the whole issue, though I doubt most people do. I advise against having just a headline and a one-line description of the article, with a link to the full text of the article. That forces your subscribers to click to read your articles. Make it easy for them.\\n\\nHow do you write these mini-articles for enewsletters? Here are some suggestions from marketing expert Ilise Benun of Marketing Mentor (www.marketing-mentor.com):\\n\\nThink of yourself as a conduit. Your job is to pass useful information along to those who can use it.\\n\\nPay close attention to questions, problems and ideas that come up when you‚Äôre doing your work or interacting with customers.\\n\\nDistill the lesson (or lessons) into a tip that you can share with your network via email, snail mail or even in simple conversation.\\n\\nState the problem or situation as an introduction to your tip. Distill it down to its essence.\\n\\nThen give the solution. Make sure you give a couple of action steps to take. Readers especially love something they can use right away.\\n\\nDescribe the result or benefit of using these solutions to provide some incentive to act. If there are tools they can use to measure the results, give them a link to websites offering these tools.\\n\\nInclude tips the reader can use without doing any work: phrases they can use verbatim, boilerplate clauses, checklists, forms and so on.\\n\\nList websites and other resources where readers can go for more information.\\n\\nNeed more ideas about what and how to craft a newsletter readers love? Copywriter John Forde offers the following tips:\\n\\nYour reader is smarter than you think. Even while educating or informing, never talk down to them. And never think they won‚Äôt notice when you haven‚Äôt done your homework.\\n\\nYour reader prefers stories to lists of facts. You‚Äôll find it a lot easier to hold on to their attention by putting plenty of human-interest angles into the articles you write.\\n\\nYour reader expects occasional profundity. The deeper you can take your reader, the greater your editor-reader relationship will be, the more they‚Äôll recommend your enewsletter to friends, and the longer they‚Äôll stay active on your mailing list.\\n\\nTrust encourages action. The more the reader trusts you, the more genuinely they regard your message, and the more likely they are to take the action you recommend.\\n\\nYour reader expects emotion. Getting personal means getting emo\\xadtional. But be careful in two ways. First, be passionate about your position, but not crazed. Second, good writers express the full range of emotions over time (fear, greed, anger, desire, vanity and so on). You can‚Äôt fake this. But don‚Äôt suppress it in your enewsletter copy, either.\\n\\nReinforce the old, introduce the new. When you‚Äôre writing an enews\\xadletter, you‚Äôre almost always ‚Äúpreaching to the choir.‚Äù That means a lot of your copy will appeal to the opinions and principles you and your readers already share. But just as much, you have to make sure you introduce, amplify and illuminate a new direction for them to take. By repeating core ideas, you reinforce your readers‚Äô good feel\\xadings about your enewsletter. By saying something new, however, you also provide understanding.\\n\\nArticle Ideas for Company Newsletters\\n\\nHere‚Äôs a checklist of 20 article ideas to help you identify topics with high reader interest that can promote your company or educate prospects:', 'author': ['Robert W.

But for best results, they belong together.\\n\\nMarch 31, 2020 6 min read\\n\\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\\n\\nInterestingly, although I lead a PR company, we don‚Äôt do SEO. However, I strongly consider SEO know-how one of the most essential advantages a PR business can have. The guiding rule of PR, in my estimation, is to provide relevant and value-add information for the people who want to receive it.\\n\\nThe job of SEO, then, is to direct that content to ensure it is seen. So in that respect, PR and SEO are best friends. As my friend Dan Posner, business development lead for Big Leap, likes to put it: ‚ÄúPR and SEO are like diet and exercise. Why would you attend to one without the other?‚Äù I agree.\\n\\nSince Google updated its core algorithm in September, SEO practices have shifted yet again. And as usual, SEO experts are pivoting to adjust. The Google game is getting more sophisticated and abstract, with forces like BERT and ‚ÄòEntities‚Äô making the algorithm ever more intelligent.\\n\\nToo often, companies are still approaching SEO from a utilitarian perspective, treating it simply as a way to harvest clicks. But forward-thinking CEOs are supporting and empowering their Chiefs of SEO, because that link on Google is often prospects\\' very first point of brand contact.\\n\\nConsidering that search engine results pages (SERPs) will provide your introduction to many of your future customers, clients and partners, it‚Äôs time to start thinking of SEO as an integral part of your PR strategy. Put on your best public face, first by ranking, and then by providing a clickable link that converts. Here‚Äôs why this crucial point of contact is good for more than inbound sales.\\n\\nRelated: 10 Fundamentals to Understanding SEO\\n\\nStop chasing clicks and build a more authoritative presence\\n\\nGoogle has been putting more effort into keeping people on the SERP instead of just clicking through. If you can earn a snippet or an answer box, you\\'ll be the one who answers many users\\' questions. You may not get the clickthrough, but you‚Äôve still won, by positioning yourself as an authoritative source in the conversation. This can be true even for a high ranking link without a snippet or an answer box.\\n\\n‚ÄúA high SERP ranking establishes you as a trusted authority,‚Äù says Guy Sheetrit, CEO of Over the Top SEO. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like being quoted in the Times (or the Post. Or even the Journal). Users will automatically associate higher ranked companies with being ‚Äòtop of their class.\\'‚Äù\\n\\nSheetrit says smart SEO now means putting less emphasis on clickthroughs, and more on brand presence. Of course, this makes it trickier to measure ROI. But the long term payoffs of being an established authority are worth it, according to him.\\n\\nGoogle doesn‚Äôt want to rank you for free\\n\\nThe SEO game was different when Google pages were comprised of the classic ‚Äú10 blue links,‚Äù meaning the top 10 organic search results, with ads peppered off to the side. But there‚Äôs no use pining for the good ol‚Äô days.\\n\\nAccording to Moz Data Scientist Pete Meyers, only 3 percent of Google SERPs now feature 10 blue links. Google pages du jour are dominated by ads, answer boxes, snippets, PAA question boxes and other flotsam. ‚ÄúThis is not the exception,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt\\'s our new reality.‚Äù\\n\\nMost people focus a majority of their effort on the high-volume terms that face heavy competition and are plastered with paid ads in the search results. But the people searching for the topics at this end of the spectrum tend to be further along in the buying process, which means they‚Äôve probably already interacted with many of your competitors.\\n\\nJeremy Knauff, founder of Spartan Media and contributor to Search Engine Journal, believes there‚Äôs a better approach.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhen you create and optimize your content to reach people earlier in the buying process, you‚Äôll have a better chance of forming a relationship with them before your competitors do,\" he says. \"An added benefit is that it‚Äôs generally a lot faster and easier to rank for these types of long-tail terms.‚Äù\\n\\nThat‚Äôs not all bad. It just means there‚Äôs a price for ranking consistently. If you want to be front and center on the SERP, above the fold and ready to make a good impression, you can buy the privilege. Whether it‚Äôs worth the price is a question for your marketing team. So make sure marketing and PR are collaborating closely with your SEO experts on shared goals and strategies.\\n\\nRelated: 7 Reasons You Should Stop Managing Your SEO and Hire a Pro\\n\\nShore up your reputation with best practices\\n\\nAccording to Google, three out of four smartphone users go to search engines first to address their immediate needs. There are 3.5 billion smartphone users worldwide, so that makes for roughly 2.625 billion people who search mobile first. The importance of optimizing for mobile cannot be overstated. Consider this principle as well: The best defense for a strong reputation is to proactively be sure you are \"on the record\" for who you really are and what you really stand for before a crisis occurs. In many kinds of crises, your attorneys or company policy may not allow you to directly respond. So the evidence that already stands may be for a period of time your best (or even your only) response.\\n\\nIn addition, you should follow the most current SEO and PR best practices:\\n\\n‚óè A secure website (https://) is now expected, not a differentiator.\\n\\n‚óè Optimize for voice search so Alexa and Siri are on your side.\\n\\n‚óè Quality text content should be longer than 2,000 words for optimal results.\\n\\n‚óè Quality video content should quickly answer users\\' questions.\\n\\n‚óè As always, optimize for the best possible mobile UX!\\n\\nFollowing these tips will get you a ranking that leads others to conclude that you\\'re at the top. More than clickthroughs, more even than conversions, strategic SEO will make you seem like an authority in your field. Don‚Äôt allow yourself to get lost in the technical end of landing SERPs and winning snippets. Allow your SEO team to fret over those. Just make sure the team you choose is aligned with your best PR thinking, to allow the full force of your marketing effort to propel you to the top of the heap.\\n\\nRelated: 6 SEO Marketing Trends in 2019 That Entrepreneurs Should Know ...', 'author': ['Cheryl Snapp Conner']}, {'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/zNwh-eAZDzk/348403', 'published': '2020-03-31T12:30:00', 'title': 'How Barstool Sports Built Its Brand', 'text': 'Entrepreneur Media, Inc. values your privacy.

The prospect may be peripherally interested in your product, but they also may be dreading the call, thinking that it will go the same way all sales calls do. If they‚Äôve had enough recently, they may even know the traditional process of the calls, down to the questions that you‚Äôll ask. Sales consulting firm Brevet reports that only 13% of customers believe a salesperson understands their needs. Reasons for this differ, but it‚Äôs often due to the salesperson not effectively communicating their comprehension of a prospect‚Äôs pain points and how their product or service can solve it.\\n\\nSo, how does one pleasantly surprise a prospect on an initial sales call? Given that 60% of buyers want to discuss pricing on the first call and 50% of buyers want to see how a product works on the first call, transparency is key. But beyond sharing all information, there are a few extra lengths a salesperson can take to establish a connection with the prospect and leave them pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nRelated: 5 Questions Every Consultant Must Ask During a Sales Call\\n\\n1. Do your research ahead of time\\n\\nFirst, even if they are, prospects don‚Äôt want to feel like just another number on your call sheet. They may be your 17th call of the day, but they shouldn‚Äôt feel this way. To take a beat between calls and seek to establish a genuine connection with the prospect, research them or their company ahead of time. Maybe they recently got some press, so you can mention the article they were featured in. Or maybe their social media accounts shows they recently went on a cruise in Alaska (though best to stick to professional pages or accounts clearly intended for public consumption; mentioning someone's personal social media can come across as creepy). However you can prove to them that you took the time to learn about them ahead of time, that will make them feel like they matter as a potential prospect to you.\\n\\nThere‚Äôs a balance to strike between being friendly and professional, but even though you're on the phone, remember to follow proper business etiquette and put a smile on your face. Wearing a genuine smile affects your tone, making it sound more positive and chipper.\\n\\n2. Show that you're human\\n\\nWhen a sales leader is training a sales team, they almost always use sales scripts. Then, after ample practice, that script feels like second nature. The problem with reciting the same scripts over and over again is that the words lose their meaning to the salesperson, so they‚Äôre just reciting the words instead of actively communicating. It makes matters worse when many prospects are used to getting on calls with sales people who have that perfectly rehearsed sales script. Avoid this at all costs. Behaviors you wouldn't normally considered positives in public speaking ‚Äî like saying, ‚Äúum‚Äù or hesitating before you speak ‚Äî can actually help the phone call feel more real, and like you haven‚Äôt said the exact sales script over one hundred times in the past few weeks.\\n\\nOne helpful tip here is to imagine that you‚Äôre talking to a friend. If a friend was interested in your product or service, you likely wouldn‚Äôt jump into your usual script. You‚Äôd talk with them more in a more casual, ‚Äòhuman‚Äô way. Talking this way to prospects helps them feel like you‚Äôre talking to them, rather than at them.\\n\\nRelated: Top 5 Counterproductive Questions to Never Ask on a Cold Call\\n\\n3. Share stories\\n\\nOne way to break from the routine of a script is to incorporate stories into the sales call. It may be a personal story, or the story of another client or customer who used your product or service. Stories are usually told a bit differently every time, so it will give you a chance to break out of the mundane rehearsal and make authentic human connections.\\n\\nThe cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner famously said that we are 22 times more likely to remember facts when presented in stories. So not only are prospects more likely to remember facts about your company when they're presented in a narrative, but it also gives you an opportunity to colorfully illustrate your company's purpose and ethos. A strong story walks the prospect through another customer‚Äôs journey: The problem they had initially, how the product or service solved that problem, and where they are now. It helps the prospect imagine themselves walking through the same journey. It‚Äôs also a good idea to have a few stories on hand, depending on the type of customer or client you were working with. Prospects want to hear about how you've helped people like them.\\n\\nThe goal is to pleasantly surprise the prospect by making it clear that you understand what they need, and that you have the right product or service to meet that need. Establishing a human connection and expressing genuine interest takes just a few tweaks to strategy and an extra few minutes to research the prospect, but can make all the difference. It‚Äôs the pleasantly surprised prospects that turn into leads, and then turn into customers or clients.\\n\\nRelated: A Wake-Up (Sales) Call to Entrepreneurs\", 'author': ['Aimee Tariq']}]}, 'reuters_money': {'rss': 'http://feeds.reuters.com/news/wealth/', 'link': 'https://www.reuters.com/finance/personal-finance', 'articles': [{'link': 'http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/rWLVLl2KJAM/elliott-hedge-fund-gains-in-march-up-2-2-for-year-client-update-idUSKBN21M009', 'published': '2020-04-04T00:41:21', 'title': 'Elliott hedge fund gains in March, up 2.2% for year: client update', 'text': 'FILE PHOTO: Paul Singer, founder and president of Elliott Management Corporation, speaks at WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S., October 25, 2016.

She is the coauthor, along with Kenneth Rogoff, of the book ‚ÄúThis Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.‚Äù\\n\\nQ: What is your take on what we are seeing so far?\\n\\nA: This didn‚Äôt start as a financial crisis, but it‚Äôs certainly evolving into one. You can‚Äôt have a standstill in economic activity and not expect it to have serious balance-sheet consequences. My expectation is that we will see a big increase in bankruptcies at the household level, at the corporate level and at the sovereign level.\\n\\nQ: Many people are looking to the Spanish Flu of 1918 for clues - what can we learn from how that pandemic played out?\\n\\nA: We don‚Äôt really have historical antecedents for a lockdown of this scale. We‚Äôve had a lot of pandemics before, from time immemorial to the last major one in 1918. But that was in World War One, and as is common with wartime economies, the big thing was production. Real GDP growth at the time was 9%, so we can‚Äôt really look to that period for lessons in economic effects.\\n\\nQ: What are you worried about, that others aren‚Äôt realizing?\\n\\nA: I worry a great deal about social unrest. You saw the number of jobless claims. The longer this lasts, the hardest-hit households will have less and less ability to cope. A prolonged scenario when people don‚Äôt have jobs, and things are shut down, is worrisome in terms of what it does to the human psyche. We haven‚Äôt really had this experience before.\\n\\nQ: Since you have looked at hundreds of financial crises, any lessons that are helpful now?\\n\\nA: This pandemic is going to leave countries, corporations and households with a lot of debt. There have been other episodes with a lot of debt, such as the end of World War Two. What experience tells us is that you have to take an out-of-the-box approach, and think seriously about writeoffs - at the household, corporate and sovereign levels. We have to be open to a greater role for the restructuring of public and private debts. That‚Äôs the healthy way to go.\\n\\nQ: How do you see this crisis developing from here?\\n\\nA: Even in a good scenario, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to return to business as usual anytime soon. Think of global trade patterns and global supply chains, with everyone relying so heavily on other countries. And remember in 1918, influenza continued to circle the globe and kill people until 1920. So I would not be expecting a pre-coronavirus environment like we had before. This is going to depress global growth for some time.\\n\\nQ: Let‚Äôs leave on a positive note - anything encouraging you see out of all this?\\n\\nA: The policy response is an upbeat note - night and day compared to the 1930s, for example. And in terms of efforts to limit human costs, we are seeing broad consensus for distancing and quarantines, which is fundamental to how long this will last.

It had two explicit digits and three other apparent digits.\\n\\nMore than five feet (1.6 meters) long, Elpistostege was primarily aquatic, with a crocodile-like body shape and flat triangular head, eyes atop the skull and numerous teeth around the jaws and in the palate. Its slender body was covered in thick scales and it had well-developed fins. It likely was the top predator in its brackish estuary ecosystem during the Devonian Period.\\n\\nIt is unclear whether it occasionally emerged onto land, but the structure of its fins would have enabled it to do so, said paleontologist and study co-author John Long of Flinders University in Australia. Its digits were still contained within the fin and not yet free moving like fingers.\\n\\nElpistostege was known only from partial fossils until this one was found in Miguasha National Park in Quebec province.\\n\\nThe four-limbed land animals that evolved from fish like Elpistostege are called tetrapods, a group now spanning amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals including humans.\\n\\nThe digits of the 30,000-plus living species of tetrapods all share the same basic pattern found in Elpistostege.

Understanding these trade-offs is vital when planning the public health response to COVID-19 because if the survival of infected patients is sufficiently sensitive to declines in the healthcare workforce, then school closures could potentially increase deaths from COVID-19.\"\\n\\nSupport for mandatory school closures to reduce cases and mortality from COVID-19 comes from experience with influenza, or models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care workforce. Few studies have considered the trade-off between case reduction and disease burden and the potential loss of healthcare workers to childcare obligations.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn the study, researchers analysed data on more than 3 million individuals between January 2018 and January 2020 to assess family structure and probable within-household childcare options for health-care workers. They identified those most likely to require additional childcare for children aged 3-12 years old in the event of school closures by type of health-care occupation nationally and across different states, assuming that early childcare for children aged under 2 years remains open. They also modelled potential declines in the health-care workforce during school closures with estimates of case reductions from school closures to identify the point at which more lives are lost from school closures than are saved.\\n\\nThe analyses suggest that around 29% of US health-care workers need to provide care for children aged 3-12 years old. In households without a non-working adult or a sibling aged 13 years or older to provide care, the researchers estimate that 15% of health-care workers will require childcare -- equivalent to around 2.3 million children nationwide -- if schools close. However, the authors note that they were unable to account for health-care workers finding alternative methods of care for their children such as babysitters or friends.\\n\\nSchool closures will be especially challenging for nurse practitioners (22% will need childcare), physician\\'s assistants (21%), diagnostic technicians (19%), and physicians and surgeons (16%), as well as nearly 13% of the nursing and home health aids who are single parents and part of the group helping the elderly with infection control in nursing homes, researchers say.\\n\\nThe US states likely to have the greatest unmet childcare needs include South Dakota (21% of health-care workers will need childcare), Oregon (21%), and Missouri (21%). In contrast, Washington DC (9% health-care workers with unmet childcare needs), New Mexico (10%), and New Jersey (11%) are least likely to have health-care worker shortages if schools close.\\n\\nFurther analysis suggests that if the case fatality fraction (the share of people who die out of all those infected) rises from 2% to more than 2.4% when the health-care workforce declines by 15%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than those they prevent. However, there is substantial variation across the country. For example, in South Dakota estimates suggest that the case fatality rate must not increase by more than 1.7% before school closures stop saving lives and start increasing overall mortality, whereas in Washington DC it is 4.1% -- this is due to the low child care obligations in Washington DC relative to South Dakota.\\n\\n\"The US healthcare system appears disproportionately prone to labour shortages from school closures, particularly among those health-care workers providing infection control in nursing homes,\" says co-lead author Dr Jude Bayham from Colorado State University, USA. \"These potential health-care workforce shortages should be a priority when assessing the potential benefits and costs of school closures, and alternative child care arrangements must be part of the school closure plan.\"\\n\\nAccording to Fenichel, \"Closing schools and distancing in general is about bending the curve to stay below hospital capacity and reduce COVID-19 mortality, but how we distance in order to bend the curve can also influence the hospital capacity we need to stay below. We need to account for both.\"\\n\\nThe authors note some important limitations of the study, including that the authors informed their model based on the influenza virus, to which children are particularly vulnerable -- however, early data on COVID-19 suggests children may be less vulnerable, so the benefits of school closures may be smaller than expected. On the other hand, the authors note that closing schools earlier in an outbreak could prevent more cases and lead to less health-care workers being infected and thus able to treat more patients. The study did not include mortality from other conditions that might occur if the health-care workforce declined, which should be taken into consideration when deciding about closing schools, the authors say.', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403162713.htm', 'published': '2020-04-03T20:27:13', 'title': 'Deep-sea worms and bacteria team up to harvest methane', 'text': 'Scientists at Caltech and Occidental College have discovered a methane-fueled symbiosis between worms and bacteria at the bottom of the sea, shedding new light on the ecology of deep-sea environments.\\n\\nThey found that bacteria belonging to the Methylococcaceae family have been hitching a ride on the feathery plumes that act as the respiratory organs of Laminatubus and Bispira worms. Methylococcaceae are methanotrophs, meaning that they harvest carbon and energy from methane, a molecule composed of carbon and hydrogen.\\n\\nThe worms, which are a few inches long, have been found in great numbers near deep-sea methane seeps, vents in the ocean floor where hydrocarbon-rich fluids ooze out into the ocean, although it was unclear why the worms favored the vents. As it turns out, the worms slowly digest the hitchhiking bacteria and thus absorb the carbon and energy that the bacteria harvest from the methane.\\n\\nThat is to say, with a little help and some extra steps, the worms have become methanotrophs themselves.\\n\\n\"These worms have long been associated with seeps, but everyone just assumed they were filter-feeding on bacteria.

Goffredi is an associate professor of biology at Occidental College in Los Angeles.\\n\\nTo probe the nature of the relationship between the worms and the bacteria, the scientists had to first use robotic submarines to take samples from deep-sea methane vents, which, in this case, lie 1,800 meters below the ocean surface.\\n\\nOnce the worms were brought topside, the scientists analyzed their tissues, cataloging the carbon isotopes that they had consumed. Carbon exists in two stable isotopic forms -- different \"flavors\" of carbon, so to speak. Around 99 percent of all carbon is carbon-12, which has six neutrons and six protons in each atomic nucleus, and about 1 percent is carbon-13 (six protons and seven neutrons). Carbon-14, a radioactive isotope, exists in trace amounts.\\n\\nAll organisms require carbon -- in some form -- to survive, and they absorb it through metabolic processes. Studying the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in an organism\\'s tissues can give clues to where that carbon came from and the conditions under which it formed. In the case of the deep-sea worms, their tissues had an unusually low ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12, meaning that the carbon in the worm\\'s body probably came from methane. Orphan and her collaborators reasoned that because the worms are incapable of processing methane directly, they must be getting their carbon from methanotrophic bacteria.\\n\\n\"The fact that we found this specific isotope of carbon throughout the worms\\' bodies and not just in their respiratory plumes indicates that they are consuming methane carbon from these bacteria,\" Orphan says. The research team followed up on this hypothesis by using molecular techniques and microscopy as well as experiments to test the ability of these worms to incorporate a modified, traceable version of methane.\\n\\nTheir research findings change our understanding of seep ecosystems and have implications for deep-sea stewardship, as methane seeps and hydrothermal vents are sure to experience increasing pressure because of human exploitation of energy and minerals.', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403162709.htm', 'published': '2020-04-03T20:27:09', 'title': 'How important is speech in transmitting coronavirus?', 'text': 'Normal speech by individuals who are asymptomatic but infected with coronavirus may produce enough aerosolized particles to transmit the infection, according to aerosol scientists at the University of California, Davis.

A better understanding of how phytochromes regulate the seasonal rhythms of plant growth will help scientists develop crops for optimal growth under the Earth\\'s new climate and might even shed light on cancer in animals.\\n\\nPhytochromes switch between active and inactive forms like a binary switch controlled by light and temperature. In direct sunlight, such as in open fields, phytochromes switch \"on,\" absorbing far-red light. This active form inhibits stem elongation, which limits how tall plants in direct sunlight can grow.\\n\\nIn shade phytochromes are less active, absorbing red. This \"off\" form releases the inhibition of stem growth, so plants grow taller in shade to compete with other plants for more sunlight.\\n\\nWithin the cell, light causes \"on\" phytochromes to coalesce into units called photobodies inside the cell nucleus.

Instead, specific photobodies disappeared in specific ranges of temperature. Increasing the temperature incrementally reduced the number of photobodies as they disappeared selectively.\\n\\n\"We found that a subset of thermostable photobodies can persist even in warm temperatures,\" Chen said. \"The rest of the foci would disappear at each stage of lower temperature. Before we thought all the foci were the same, but now we know they are all different.\"\\n\\nThe mechanism that makes them disappear selectively must be different from the mechanism that makes them disappear in shade. This suggests individual photobodies could be sensors for specific temperature ranges.\\n\\nThe study also showed phytochrome B reacts to temperature from two different locations on the molecule. The first part senses temperature; the second part forms foci. Foci formed by this second location are insensitive to temperature. This shows light and temperature are sensed by the same part of the molecule but result in different behaviors.\\n\\n\"Photobodies are large, dynamic protein complexes. Our results suggest that each of them could have a different composition,\" Chen said. \"What we think is that the unique composition of individual photobodies make them react to temperature differently.

Though no known cases of COVID-19 have been caused by sewage leaks, the novel coronavirus is closely related to the one that causes SARS, and infection via this route could be possible.\\n\\nThe novel coronavirus could also colonize biofilms that line drinking water systems, making showerheads a possible source of aerosolized transmission. This transmission pathway is thought to be a major source of exposure to the bacteria that causes Legionnaire\\'s disease, for example.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nFortunately, most water treatment routines are thought to kill or remove coronaviruses effectively in both drinking and wastewater. Oxidation with hypochlorous acid or peracetic acid, and inactivation by ultraviolet irradiation, as well as chlorine, are thought to kill coronaviruses. In wastewater treatment plants that use membrane bioreactors, the synergistic effects of beneficial microorganisms and the physical separation of suspended solids filter out viruses concentrated in the sewage sludge.\\n\\nLiu and Naddeo caution, however, that most of these methods have not been studied for effectiveness specifically on SARS-CoV-19 and other coronaviruses, and they have called for additional research.\\n\\nThey also suggest upgrading existing water and wastewater treatment infrastructure in outbreak hot spots, which possibly receive coronavirus from places such as hospitals, community clinics, and nursing homes. For example, energy-efficient, light-emitting, diode-based, ultraviolet point-of-use systems could disinfect water before it enters the public treatment system.\\n\\nPotable water-reuse systems, which purify wastewater back into tap water, also need thorough investigation for coronavirus removal, and possibly new regulatory standards for disinfection, the researchers wrote.\\n\\nThe extent to which viruses can colonize biofilms is also not yet known. Biofilms are thin, slimy bacterial growths that line the pipes of many aging drinking water systems. Better monitoring of coronaviruses in biofilms might be necessary to prevent outbreaks.\\n\\nThe surge in household use of bactericides, virucides and disinfectants will probably cause an increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment. Treated wastewater discharged into natural waterways demands careful monitoring through the entire water cycle. Liu and Naddeo call on chemists, environmental engineers, microbiologists, and public health specialists to develop multidisciplinary and practical solutions for safe drinking water and healthy aquatic environments.\\n\\nLastly, developing countries and some regions within highly developed nations, such as rural and impoverished communities, which lack the basic infrastructure to remove other common contaminants might not be able to remove SARS-CoV-19 either. These places might experience frequent COVID-19 outbreaks that spread easily through globalized trade and travel.

The current study (along with earlier ones) shows, by contrast, that tiny, aerosolized droplets can indeed diffuse through the air.

The most prominent Dirac material is graphene, but further members have been discovered during the past 15 years or so. Each one of them serves as a rich playground for exploring 'exotic' electronic behaviours, some of which hold the promise to enable novel components for electronics. However, even if Dirac matter and other so-called topological materials -- in which electrons behave in similarly unexpected ways -- are among the currently most intensively studied condensed-matter systems, there are only very few examples where the topology of the electronic bands is connected in a well-defined manner to the magnetic properties of the materials. One material in which such interplay between topological electronic states and magnetism has been observed is CaMnBi2, but the mechanism connecting the two remained unclear. Writing in Physical Review Letters, postdoc Run Yang and PhD student Matteo Corasaniti from the Optical Spectroscopy group of Prof. Leonardo Degiorgi at the Laboratory for Solid State Physics of ETH Zurich, working with colleagues at Brookhaven National Laboratory (US) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, now report a comprehensive study in which they provide clear evidence that it is a slight nudge on the magnetic moments, known as spin canting, that provokes substantial changes in the electronic band structure.\\n\\nCompass points to the right direction on a bumpy road\\n\\nCaMnBi2 and the related compound SrMnBi2 have recently attracted attention as they display quantum magnetism -- the manganese ions are antiferromagnetically ordered at around room temperature and below -- and at the same time they host Dirac electrons. That there is interplay between the two properties has been suspected for some while, not least as at ~50 K there appears an unexpected 'bump' in the conduction properties at these materials. But the precise nature of this anomaly was still poorly understood until now.\\n\\nIn earlier work studying optical properties, Corasaniti, Yang and co-workers had established already a link to the electronic properties of the material. They used in particular the fact that the bump-like anomaly in the transport properties can be shifted in temperature by replacing some of the calcium atoms with sodium. To get now to the microscopic origins of the observed behaviour, they studied samples with different sodium dopings by torque magnetometry. In this technique, the torque on a magnetic sample is measured when it is exposed to a suitably strong field, similarly as a compass needle aligns with the Earth magnetic field. And this approach proved to point the team to the origins of the anomaly.\\n\\nA firm link between magnetic and electronic properties\\n\\nIn their magnetic-torque experiments, the researchers found that at temperatures where no anomaly is observed in the electronic transport measurements, the magnetic behaviour is such as one would expect for an antiferromagnet. This was not the case anymore at temperatures at which the anomaly is present. There, a ferromagnetic component appeared, which can be explained by a projection of magnetic moments onto the plane orthogonal to the easy spin c-axis of the original antiferromagnetic order. This phenomenon is known as spin-canting, induced by a so-called super-exchange mechanism.\\n\\nThese two sets of experiments -- optical and torque measurements -- were supported by dedicated first-principles calculations. In particular, for the case where spin canting was included in the calculations, a peculiar hybridization between the manganese and bismuth atoms was found to mediate the interlayer magnetic coupling and to govern the electronic properties in the material. Taken together, the study therefore establishes that sought-after direct link between the magnetic properties and changes to the electronic band structure, reflected in the bump anomaly of the transport properties.\\n\\nWith such detailed understanding on board, the door is now open to exploring not only the electronic properties of CaMnBi2 and related compounds, but also the possibilities arising from the connection between magnetic properties and topological states in these intriguing forms of matter.\", 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403124931.htm', 'published': '2020-04-03T16:49:31', 'title': 'Treating COVID-19 in a patient with multiple myeloma: Tocilizumab shows promise in addressing COVID-19 symptoms for people with blood cancers', 'text': 'A case study of a patient in Wuhan, China, suggests that the immunosuppressant tocilizumab may be an effective COVID-19 treatment for very ill patients who also have multiple myeloma and other blood cancers.\\n\\nThe report, published in Blood Advances, also suggests that blood cancer patients may have atypical COVID-19 symptoms.\\n\\nThe patient, a 60-year-old male who had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2015 and was on maintenance therapy, was hospitalized in February for chest tightness and shortness of breath.

The experiences in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore suggest that social distancing orders if lifted after short periods will have to be periodically reinstated to control COVID-19 flare-ups.\\n\\nWhile much has been written about poor food and lack of physical activity in schools, the data show that children experience unhealthy weight gain primarily during the summer months when they are out of school. Unhealthy weight gain over the summer school recess is particularly apparent for Hispanic and African-American youth, and children who are already overweight.\\n\\n\"There could be long-term consequences for weight gained while children are out of school during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" says Rundle, who specializes in research to prevent childhood obesity. \"Research shows that weight gained over the summer months is maintained during the school year and accrues summer to summer.

In regards to physical activity, social distancing and stay at home orders reduce the opportunities for exercise, particularly for children in urban areas living in small apartments. Sedentary activities and screen time are expected to expand under social distancing orders; available data show that online video game usage is already soaring. Screen time is associated with experiencing overweight/obesity in childhood, likely because of the dual issues of sedentary time and the association between screen time and snacking.\\n\\nHow to Prevent Childhood Obesity During the Pandemic\\n\\nThe authors present several interventions for reducing risk factors for unhealthy weight gain during the school closures:\\n\\nSome school districts are offering students grab-and-go meals at school sites or via buses running along their regular pick-up routes. Research shows that food insecurity is associated with unhealthy weight among children, and addressing food insecurity will likely have long term benefits for child health.\\n\\nFarmers markets, which often provide specialty and ethnic produce and prepared foods valued by immigrant communities.

Sometimes the hunt takes place inside large supercolliders, where spectacular collisions are necessary to find hidden particles and new physics. For physicists studying solids, the game occurs in a much different environment and the sought-after particles don\\'t come from furious collisions. Instead, particle-like entities, called quasiparticles, emerge from complicated electronic interactions that happen deep within a material. Sometimes the quasiparticles are easy to probe, but others are more difficult to spot, lurking just out of reach.\\n\\nNow a team of researchers at the University of Illinois, led by physicist Vidya Madhavan, in collaboration with researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the University of Maryland, Boston College, and ETH Zurich, have used high-resolution microscopy tools to peer at the inner-workings of an unusual type of superconductor, uranium ditelluride (UTe2). Their measurements reveal strong evidence that this material may be a natural home to an exotic quasiparticle that\\'s been hiding from physicists for decades. The study is published in the March 26 issue of Nature.\\n\\nThe particles in question were theorized back in 1937 by an Italian physicist named Ettore Majorana, and since then, physicists have been trying to prove that they can exist. Scientists think a particular class of materials called chiral unconventional superconductors may naturally host Majoranas. UTe2 may have all of the right properties to spawn these elusive quasiparticles.\\n\\n\"We know the physics of conventional superconductors and understand how they can conduct electricity or transport electrons from one end of a wire to the other with no resistance,\" said Madhavan. \"Chiral unconventional superconductors are much rarer, and the physics is less well known. Understanding them is important for fundamental physics and has potential applications in quantum computing,\" she said.\\n\\nInside of a normal superconductor, the electrons pair up in a way that enables the lossless, persistent currents. This is in contrast to a normal conductor, like copper wire, which heats up as current passes through it. Part of the theory behind superconductivity was formulated decades ago by three scientists at the U of I who earned a Nobel prize in physics for their work. For this conventional kind of superconductivity, magnetic fields are the enemy and break up the pairs, returning the material back to normal. Over the last year, researchers showed that uranium ditelluride behaves differently.\\n\\nIn 2019, Sheng Ran, Nicholas Butch (both co-authors on this study) and their collaborators announced that UTe2 remains superconducting in the presence of magnetic fields up to 65 Tesla, which is about 10,000 times stronger than a refrigerator magnet. This unconventional behavior, combined with other measurements, led the authors of that paper to surmise that the electrons were pairing up in an unusual way that enabled them to resist break-ups. The pairing is important because superconductors with this property could very likely have Majorana particles on the surface. The new study from Madhavan and collaborators strengthens the case for this.\\n\\nThe team used a high-resolution microscope called a scanning tunneling microscope to look for evidence of the unusual electron pairing and Majorana particles. This microscope can not only map out the surface of uranium ditelluride down to the level of atoms but also probe what\\'s happening with the electrons. The material itself is silvery with steps jutting up from the surface. These step features are where evidence for Majorana quasiparticles is best seen. They provide a clean edge that, if predictions are correct, should show signatures of a continuous current that moves in one direction, even without the application of a voltage. The team scanned opposite sides of the step and saw a signal with a peak. But the peak was different, depending on which side of the step was scanned.\\n\\n\"Looking at both sides of the step, you see a signal that is a mirror image of each other. In a normal superconductor, you cannot find that,\" said Madhavan. \"The best explanation for seeing the mirror images is that we are directly measuring the presence of moving Majorana particles,\" said Madhavan. The team says that the measurements indicate that free-moving Majorana quasiparticles are circulating together in one direction, giving rise to mirrored, or chiral, signals.\\n\\nMadhavan says the next step is to make measurements that would confirm that the material has broken time-reversal symmetry. This means that the particles should move differently if the arrow of time were theoretically reversed. Such a study would provide additional evidence for the chiral nature of UTe2.\\n\\nIf confirmed, uranium ditelluride would be the only material, other than superfluid He-3, proven to be a chiral unconventional superconductor. \"This is a huge discovery that will allow us to understand this rare kind of superconductivity, and maybe, in time, we could even manipulate Majorana quasiparticles in a useful way for quantum information science.\"', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403115121.htm', 'published': '2020-04-03T15:51:21', 'title': 'An antibiotic masquerading as a natural compound in the Giant Madeiran Squill', 'text': 'A previous study has shown that a type of squill growing in Madeira produces a chemical compound that may be useful as a medicinal drug.

Some of these are produced with the goal of protecting the organism, e.g. the toxic compounds produced by plants to poison herbivores. The fields of pharmacognosy and natural products chemistry are focussed on taking these compounds from nature and repurposing them for use in human medicine.\\n\\nToday, we know quite a lot about biosynthesis within different organisms. Using this knowledge, we can even predict the kinds of chemical compounds that we expect to find within nature -- and the ones we do not.\\n\\nThis knowledge led Luke Robertson, postdoctoral fellow working between the Department of Ecology and Genetics and the Department of Medicinal Chemistry, to question the proposed structure of a chemical compound discovered within the Madeiran Squill (Scilla madeirensis, Asparagaceae). A previous study had reported that a compound produced by the plant might be useful for the treatment of prostate hyperplasia. But the structure of the compound looked strange: it did not fit with any known biosynthetic pathway. Closer examination led Robertson to the conclusion that the researchers had not only misidentified the chemical structure -- but that they had found a substance that was not produced by the plant at all. They had discovered a synthetic antibiotic: sulfadiazine.\\n\\n\"The tools we use to identify the structures of organic compounds can be complex; we don\\'t just put data into a computer and it then spits out a chemical structure back at us. It\\'s like solving a riddle -- and two people might have different answers to the same riddle\" said Luke Robertson.\\n\\nBut where did the sulfadiazine come from? While the compound was clearly isolated from within the plant, we know that sulfadiazine is synthetic; that is, produced only by humans. The only reasonable explanation, according to Robertson, is that the drug had contaminated the plant and the surrounding area through polluted fertilizer. Sulfadiazine is widely used within the livestock industry and is known to be spread throughout the environment via animal manure. The compound then builds up within soil and is later accumulated within plants.\\n\\n\"It is incredibly important that we identify chemical structures correctly.

Drylands, which primarily include savannas, grasslands and shrublands, are important for supporting grazing and non-irrigated croplands around the world.

Furthermore, due to expected changes in precipitation and temperatures, the amount of productivity in any one dryland area will decrease.\\n\\nIn addition, the researchers found that expansion among different types of drylands will lead to large changes in regional and subtype contributions to global dryland productivity.\\n\\nDrylands will experience substantial expansion and degradation in the future due to climate change, wildfire and human activities, including changes to their ecosystem structures as well as to their productivity, said Heping Liu, professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and corresponding author on the paper.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nBecause these regions are already water stressed, they are particularly sensitive to temperature or precipitation changes.

In the U.S. Southwest, the introduction of invasive species has changed dryland regions from green to brown.

Nine patients from this \\'Munich cluster\\' subsequently received treatment at M√ºnchen Klinik Schwabing. \"At that point time, we really knew very little about the novel coronavirus which we now refer to as SARS-CoV-2,\" says one of the study\\'s lead authors, Prof. Dr. Christian Drosten, Director of the Institute of Virology on Campus Charit√© Mitte.

In addition to getting a good picture of how this virus behaves, this also enabled us to gain other important insights, including on viral transmission.\"\\n\\nAll nine patients underwent daily testing using both nasopharyngeal (nose and throat) swabs and sputum samples. Testing continued throughout the course of their illness and up to 28 days after the initial onset of symptoms. The researchers also collected stool, blood and urine samples whenever possible or practical. All of the samples collected were then tested for SARS-CoV-2 by two separate laboratories working independently of each other: the Institute of Virology on Campus Charit√© Mitte in Berlin and the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, an institution which forms part of the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF).\\n\\nAccording to the researchers\\' observations, all COVID-19 patients showed a high rate of viral replication and shedding in the throat during the first week of symptoms. Sputum samples also showed high levels of viral RNA (genetic information). Infectious viral particles were isolated from both pharyngeal (throat) swabs and sputum samples. \"This means that the novel coronavirus does not have to travel to the lungs to replicate. It can replicate while still in the throat, which means it is very easy to transmit,\" explains Prof. Drosten, who is also affiliated with the DZIF, and is a professor at the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH). Due to genetic similarities between the new virus and the original SARS virus, the researchers initially assumed that, just like the SARS virus, the novel coronavirus would predominantly target the lungs -- thus making human-to-human transmission more difficult. \"However, our research involving the Munich cluster showed that the new SARS coronavirus differs quite considerably in terms of its preferential target tissue,\" says the virologist, and adds: \"Naturally, this has enormous consequences for both viral transmission and spread, which is why we decided to publish our initial findings in early February.\"\\n\\nIn most cases, viral load decreased significantly during the first week of symptoms. While viral shedding in the lungs also decreased, this decline happened later than in the throat. The researchers were no longer able to obtain infectious virus particles from day 8 after the initial onset of symptoms. However, levels of viral RNA remained high in both the throat and lungs. The researchers found that samples with fewer than 100,000 copies of viral RNA no longer contained any infectious viral particles. This allowed the researchers to draw two conclusions: \"A high viral load in the throat at the very onset of symptoms suggests that individuals with COVID-19 are infectious very early on, potentially before they are even aware of being ill,\" explains Colonel PD Dr. Roman W√∂lfel, Director of the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology and one of the study\\'s first authors. \"At the same time, the infectiousness of COVID-19 patients appears to be linked to viral load in the throat and lungs. In hospitals with limited bed capacity and the resultant pressure to expedite patient discharge, this is an important factor when it comes to deciding the earliest point at which a patient can be safely discharged.\" Based on these data, the study\\'s authors suggest that COVID-19 patients with less than 100,000 viral RNA copies in their sputum sample on day 10 of symptoms could be discharged into home-based isolation.\\n\\nThe researchers\\' work also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the researchers were unable to isolate any infectious virus from patients\\' stool samples. None of the blood and urine samples tested positive for the virus. Serum samples were also tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Half of the patients tested had developed antibodies by day 7 following symptom onset; antibodies were detected in all patients after two weeks. The onset of antibody production coincided with a gradual decrease in viral load.\\n\\nThe Munich- and Berlin-based research groups plan to conduct additional research on the development of long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2, both within the first German cluster and in other patients.

What the scientists have now achieved is to develop a perovskite that comprises a light-emitting diode and that at the same time is an excellent photodetector.\\n\\nAll optical communication requires rapid and reliable photodetectors -- devices that capture light and convert it into an electrical signal. Current optical communication systems use photodetectors made from materials such as silicon and indium gallium arsenide. These are, however, expensive and they cannot be used in applications that require low weight, flexibility, or large surfaces.\\n\\n\"In order to demonstrate the potential of our diode with double function, we have built a monolithic sensor that detects heart beats in real time, and an optical, bidirectional communication system,\" says Chunxiong Bao, researcher in the Division of Biomolecular and Organic Electronics.\\n\\nThis tiny unit that can both receive and transmit optical signals provides a unique opportunity to simplify and shrink the functionality of the current optical systems, in particular given that it can also be integrated with traditional electronic circuits.\\n\\n\"We have managed to integrate optical signal transmission and reception into one circuit, something that makes it possible to transmit optical signals in both directions between two identical circuits.

The research, led by the University of Bristol and published in Communications Biology, provides compelling evidence that when root hairs interact with the surrounding soil they reduce soil erosion and increase soil cohesion by binding soil particles.\\n\\nSoil erosion can have a devastating impact across the globe and a serious threat for modern agriculture. The increased demand for agriculture has led to forests and natural grasslands being converted to farm fields and pastures.\\n\\nHowever, many of the plants grown, such as coffee, cotton and palm oil, can significantly increase soil erosion beyond the soil\\'s ability to maintain and renovate. It can also lead to increased pollution and sedimentation in streams and rivers or, because these areas are often less able to hold onto water, can worsen flooding. This problem is particularly urgent considering the ever-expanding human population and climate change.\\n\\nResearchers from the Universities of Bristol and Exeter have revealed the crucial function the microscopic roots hairs play in binding and reinforcing soil.\\n\\nWhile the larger-scale root properties such as diameter, length and surface area have been extensively studied to understand their role in preventing soil erosion, the effect that micro-scale properties, such as root hairs, has is less well documented.\\n\\nThe research team looked at how wild plants Arabidopsis thaliana, which produced root hairs, compared with an almost identical Arabidopsis with the same root hair structure in reducing soil erosion.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThey found that, when planted in sufficient density, plants with root hairs reduced soil loss almost completely -- while otherwise identical plants without hairs could not stem the flow of erosion.\\n\\nThree methods were used to explore the soil retention benefits of root hairs.

The study found that the hairless seedlings were easier to remove from the gel compared to seedlings abundant with root hairs.\\n\\nSecond, the study found that root hairs were also shown to stabilise the plant in the soil, as they increased the force needed to uproot the plant.\\n\\nThird, in the experimental landscapes laboratory at Exeter, root hairs reduced water erosion to almost zero.\\n\\nProfessor Claire Grierson, one of the study\\'s lead authors from Bristol\\'s School of Biological Sciences explained: \"These findings could be the key in helping to tackle soil erosion.

According to the researchers, peatlands will remain carbon sinks until the end of this century, but their sink capacity will be substantially reduced after 2050, if the climate warms significantly.\\n\\nPeatlands develop in waterlogged conditions which slow down plant decomposition rates, so that layers of dead plant material accumulate over many years as peat. They are a huge storehouse for significant quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. Despite only covering around 3% of the Earth\\'s surface, peatlands contain roughly a fifth of its soil carbon. In Europe, these ecosystems store five times more CO2 than forests.\\n\\nA Nordic team of researchers used novel arctic modelling tools and previously published data on peatland carbon accumulation rates, vegetation and permafrost characteristics to study the role of northern peatlands in regulating the regional climate. A major concern is whether these ecosystems will continue to remain carbon sinks and help in mitigating climate change under changing climatic conditions. The modelling study, published in Global Change Biology, aims to address these important questions.\\n\\nThe model (LPJ-GUESS Peatland) used in this study captured the broad patterns of long-term peatland carbon dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales. The model successfully simulated reasonable vegetation patterns and permafrost extent across the pan-Arctic. Under contrasting warming scenarios (mild and severe), the study showed that peatlands on average continue to remain carbon sinks until the end of this century. However, their sink capacity would be substantially reduced after 2050 under the high-warming scenario due to an increase in soil mineralization rates. This modelling approach contributes to a better understanding of peatland dynamics and its role in the global climate system at different spatiotemporal scales. A major uncertainty of future predictions is the impact of formation of new peatlands with potential change in the peatland sink capacity owing to permafrost thawing and possible landscape changes.\\n\\n\"With this study our aim is to highlight the importance of peatlands in the global carbon cycle. We adopted an advanced peatland modelling tool to address the issues pertaining to peatland carbon balance in the past and future climate conditions. Now, our plan is to take forward our current research on the role of peatlands in regulating the regional climate by coupling our state-of-the-art peatland model with global and regional climate models in order to quantify the peatland-mediated feedbacks,\" says Postdoctoral Fellow Nitin Chaudhary, the lead author of the study, from the University of Oslo.\\n\\n\"Arctic carbon balance modelling studies working with coarse spatial resolution (half-grid scale) have often ignored the role of peatlands.

This arrangement is created in the embryo by the sequential formation of a long row of structures called somites (see image), which later give rise to the vertebrae and ribs. This periodic pattern of somites is created by a group of genes known as the segmentation clock. Molecular interactions within the cell cause the expression of these genes to oscillate, with gene activity rising and falling in a regular pattern over time (see movie below). For each oscillation, another somite is formed. Errors in this segmentation clock can cause hereditary disorders of the vertebrae, such as the rare condition spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD).\\n\\nThe dynamics of the human segmentation clock and related diseases cannot be studied directly in human embryos, so EMBL Research Scientist Mitsuhiro Matsuda and collaborators tried to create a system for studying this process in the lab. They created cell lines that each lacked a gene thought to be the causative mutation of SCD -- which can be caused by any of several genes -- in different patients. They cultured these cells to create simplified versions of an embryo that show many of the same characteristics. While cells lacking a gene called HES7 failed to show oscillations, cells lacking the genes DLL3 and LFNG surprisingly showed intact oscillations. However, despite oscillations occurring in these cell lines at the single-cell level, they did not properly coordinate across the tissue to form synchronised collective oscillations or travelling waves of gene activity.\\n\\nFurther tests\\n\\nThese experiments demonstrated that the culture system the scientists has created could reveal SCD mutations that had been engineered into otherwise healthy cells. But what about testing patients\\' cells directly? They established a new cell line from a patient with a mutation in DLL3, and tested it in vitro. As expected, this cell line failed to show travelling waves. To provide the strongest evidence that the DLL3 mutation was the cause, the researchers used the gene editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 to correct the patient\\'s mutation. This restored the normal synchronisation of the segmentation clock in the in vitro tissue, proving that this specific mutation was responsible.\\n\\n\"The segmentation clock, the mechanism underlying the periodic structures of the vertebral column, has been recapitulated in vitro. We also succeeded in evaluating two important properties of the segmentation clock separately: oscillation and synchronisation,\" says EMBL group leader Miki Ebisuya. \"HES7, DLL3, and LFNG were already known as causative genes of SCD. But, for many SCD patients, the causative genes are still unknown.

Brain scans from this period showed that the stressed individuals were less likely than their counterparts to activate the hippocampus -- a brain structure that would have been active if they were mentally reviewing previous journeys.

However, the hormone also plays an important role in animals\\' biological rhythms. Artificial light at night -- light pollution -- can suppress the production of melatonin in fish, even at very low light intensities, a finding established by researchers from the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB).\\n\\nMelatonin regulates the day-night rhythm in humans and vertebrates. Organs, tissue and cells set their internal clock depending on the level of this hormone. As a result, melatonin also controls processes such as reproduction and growth. Vertebrates and humans detect differences in ambient brightness via photoreceptors, e.g. on the retina of the eye. Bright light perceived by these receptors suppresses the production of melatonin, while the hormone level is elevated during the dark phase. Artificial light at night may disturb melatonin levels.\\n\\nThe team of IGB researchers investigated melatonin production in European perch. During the day, all fish were exposed to daylight. At night, lighting varied depending on the group: the control group spent the night in complete darkness, whereas the other three groups were exposed to light intensities at 0.01, 0.1 and 1 lux. After ten days, the scientists measured melatonin levels at three-hour intervals over a period of 24 hours. The result: even the lowest light intensity of 0.01 lux was enough to suppress melatonin production; higher light intensities led to an increasingly strong gradual reduction of melatonin.\\n\\nFor comparison, illumination intensities to which organisms are exposed at night: on a crystal clear night, illumination intensity is less than 0.001 lux. On a full moon night, it measures a maximum of 0.3 lux. Sky glow over a city can reach illumination intensities of up to 1 lux and more, and street can lighting anything up to 150 lux.\\n\\nEven nighttime urban sky glow suppresses melatonin formation\\n\\n\"The astonishing thing is that the intensities of urban sky glow are enough to suppress melatonin production in fish,\" stated lead author Franziska Kupprat from IGB. Large areas throughout the world are affected by this kind of light pollution. This is because light emitted by lighting installations radiates into the sky, and reflects off clouds and particles, creating significant sky glow that extends further than the actual light radius of the light source.\\n\\nLight intensity had no impact on the rhythm of melatonin production. All specimens experienced an increase in melatonin formation during the course of the afternoon, peaking at night.\\n\\n\"Previous studies have shown that higher intensities of night light, such as 10 and 100 lux, also affect the melatonin rhythm in perch.

Like with all living things, fish need sleep to regenerate. IGB\\'s Professor Werner Kloas, lead investigator of the study, explained the effects of disturbed melatonin levels: \"Our previous research methods do not enable us to assess whether urban fish experience a lack of sleep due to light pollution. However, we assume this is the case because melatonin is an important factor influencing sleep in vertebrates, including fish. One thing for sure is that other body functions such as immune defence, growth and reproduction can be disturbed by altered melatonin production.\"', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403103952.htm', 'published': '2020-04-03T14:39:52', 'title': 'To divide or not to divide?

But this new research used time lapse microscopy and cell tracking technologies, which allowed the scientists to film cells doing their own thing, on their own time.\\n\\n\"Doing the experiment this way led to very different results,\" said Spencer.\\n\\nThe researchers tracked thousands of cells across 48 hours, using computational cell tracking -- which can track the same cell through hundreds of sequential images.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nEven 10 years ago, very few labs could track cells even for a couple of hours, said Spencer.\\n\\nSignals and memory\\n\\nTheir next question was: when in the mother cell cycle does a cell decide if its daughter cells will divide?\\n\\nTo answer this, the researchers removed and replaced the growth factors -- which give the signal for the cell to divide -- for several hours at different phases in the mother cell cycle.\\n\\nThey found that the longer these growth factors were removed in the mother cell, the less likely the daughter cells were to divide. If the growth factors were removed for more than nine hours, none of the daughter cells ended up dividing.\\n\\n\"We found that no matter when you blocked this signaling, cells can sense it,\" said Mingwei Min, first author and postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biochemistry and BioFrontiers Institute. \"And not only can they sense it, they can remember that information for many hours, all the way through to the daughter cell cycle.\"\\n\\nIf cells are continually sensing growth factor signaling -- as this new paper found -- instead of only in the first phase of the daughter cycle, cancer drugs may have a longer window than previously believed to provide therapeutic effects.\\n\\nBut how are cells remembering the availability of growth factors? The key lies in a protein known as Cyclin D.\\n\\nNormally, Cyclin D rises up in the second half of the cell cycle in the mother cell. But when growth factors were removed and replaced in the experiment, there was less Cyclin D at the end of the mother cell cycle, the study found.\\n\\nAnd without as much Cyclin D, the daughter cells have less of the thing they need to be able to divide.\\n\\n\"The fact that cells can store memory -- or integrate past history -- of growth factor availability is a new finding,\" said Spencer. \"The combination of fluorescent sensor design, long-term time-lapse microscopy, and cell tracking is really our forte that enabled this discovery.\"\\n\\nAdditional authors on this paper include Yao Rong and Chengzhe Tian of the Department of Biochemistry and the BioFrontiers Institute at CU Boulder.', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403103944.htm', 'published': '2020-04-03T14:39:44', 'title': 'Vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 being tested', 'text': 'South Australian researchers working with Oracle Cloud technology and vaccine technology developed by local company Vaxine Pty Ltd are testing a vaccine candidate against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThe team is headed by Nikolai Petrovsky, Flinders University Professor and Research Director at Vaxine.\\n\\nHis team has tapped Oracle for technical collaboration, access to an expanded research community, and cloud infrastructure that helped enable the rapid design of the novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate.\\n\\n\"The vaccine has progressed into animal testing in the US and, once we confirm it is safe and effective, will then be advanced into human trials,\" says Professor Petrovsky -- stressing expectations shouldn\\'t be elevated until all testing is completed.\\n\\nThe latest cloud-based technology provided by Oracle enabled the team to \"dramatically speed up our ability to analyse the COVID-19 virus and use this information to design the vaccine candidate.\"\\n\\n\"As soon as the genomic sequence of COVID-19 became available in January, we immediately used this, combined with our previous experience in developing a SARS coronavirus vaccine, to characterise the key viral attachment molecule called the spike protein,\" Professor Petrovsky says.\\n\\n\"We used computer models of the spike protein and its human receptor, ACE2, to identify how the virus was infecting human cells, and then were able to design a vaccine to block this process,\" he says.\\n\\nFlinders University Associate Professor Dimitar Sajkov, a respiratory physician in South Australia, has been involved in conducting previous human trials of the team\\'s pandemic vaccines and hopes to similarly lead clinical trials of this new COVID-19 vaccine candidate.\\n\\n\"The team has exploited the very latest technologies, including AI, advanced manufacturing and Cloud computing to accelerate vaccine design, shaving years off normal development timeframes,\" Professor Sajkov says.\\n\\n\"We achieved great results with Vaxine\\'s swine flu vaccine developed during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, where we commenced clinical trials of a vaccine within 3 months of discovery of the virus.

However, the protracted brain growth suggests that -- as is the case in humans -- infants may have had a long dependence on caregivers.\\n\\nThe species Australopithecus afarensis inhabited East Africa more than three million years ago, and occupies a key position in the hominin family tree, as it is widely accepted to be ancestral to all later hominins, including the human lineage. \"Lucy and her kind provide important evidence about early hominin behavior. They walked upright, had brains that were around 20 percent larger than those of chimpanzees, may have used sharp stone tools,\" explains senior author Zeresenay Alemseged from the University of Chicago, who directs the Dikika field project in Ethiopia, where the skeleton of an Australopithecus child was found in the year 2000. \"Our new results show how their brains developed, and how they were organized,\" adds Alemseged.\\n\\nTo study brain growth and organization in Australopithecus afarensis the researchers scanned the fossil cranium of the Dikika child using synchrotron microtomography at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. With the help of this state-of the-art technology researchers can reveal the age at death with a precision of a few weeks.\\n\\nIn addition, seven other well-preserved fossil crania from the Ethiopian sites Dikika and Hadar were scanned using high-resolution conventional tomography. Several years of painstaking fossil reconstruction, and counting of dental growth lines, yielded an exceptionally preserved brain imprint of the Dikika child, a precise age at death, new endocranial volume estimates, and previously undetected endocranial features of well-known Australopithecus fossils.\\n\\nThese data shed new light on two questions that have been controversial: Is there evidence for human-like brain reorganization in Australopithecus afarensis? Was the pattern of brain growth in A. afarensis more similar to that of chimpanzees or that of humans?\\n\\nExtended childhood\\n\\nContrary to previous claims, the endocranial imprints of Australopithecus afarensis reveal an ape-like brain organization, and no features derived towards humans. However, a comparison of infant and adult endocranial volumes nevertheless indicates more human-like protracted brain growth in Australopithecus afarensis, likely critical for the evolution of a long period of childhood learning in hominins.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe brains of modern humans are not only much larger than those of our closest living ape relatives, they are also organized differently, and take longer to grow and mature. For example, compared with chimpanzees, modern human infants learn longer at the expense of being entirely dependent on parental care for longer periods of time. Together, these characteristics are important for human cognition and social behavior, but their evolutionary origins remain unclear. Brains do not fossilize, but as the brain grows and expands before and after birth, the tissues surrounding its outer layer leave an imprint in the bony braincase. Based on these endocasts the researchers could measure endocranial volume, and infer key aspects of brain organization from impressions of brain convolutions in the skull.\\n\\nDifferences in brain organization\\n\\nA key difference between apes and humans involves the organization of the brain\\'s parietal and occipital lobes. \"In all ape brains, a well-defined lunate sulcus approximates the anterior boundary of the primary visual cortex of the occipital lobes,\" explains co-author Dean Falk from Florida State University, a specialist in interpreting endocranial imprints. Some have previously argued that structural changes of the brain resulted in a more backwards (human-like) placement of the lunate sulcus on endocasts of australopiths, and eventually to the disappearance of a clear endocranial impression in humans. Hypothetically, such brain reorganization in australopiths could have been linked to behaviors that were more complex than those of their great ape relatives (e.g., tool manufacture, mentalizing, and vocal communication). Unfortunately, the lunate sulcus typically does not reproduce well on endocasts, so there is unresolved controversy about its position in australopiths.\\n\\nThe exceptionally well preserved endocast of the Dikika child has an unambiguous impression of a lunate sulcus in an ape-like position. Likewise, the computed tomographic scans reveal a previously undetected impression of an ape-like lunate sulcus in a well-known fossil of an adult Australopithecus individual from Hadar (A.L. 162-28). Contrary to previous claims, the researchers did not find evidence for brain reorganization in any Australopithecus afarensis endocast that preserves detailed sulcal impressions.\\n\\nVirtual dental histology\\n\\nIn infants, synchrotron computed tomographic scans of the dentition make it possible to determine an individual\\'s age at death by counting dental growth lines. Similar to the growth rings of a tree, virtual sections of a tooth reveal incremental growth lines reflecting the body\\'s internal rhythm. Studying the fossilized teeth of the Dikika infant, the team\\'s dental experts Paul Tafforeau (ESRF), Adeline Le Cabec (ESRF/Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology), and Tanya Smith (Griffith University) calculated an age at death of 861 days (2.4 years).\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\"After seven years of work, we finally had all the puzzle pieces to study the evolution of brain growth,\" says lead author Philipp Gunz: \"The age at death of the Dikika child and its endocranial volume, the endocranial volumes of the best-preserved adult Australopithecus afarensis fossils, and comparative data of more than 1600 modern humans and chimpanzees.\"\\n\\nProtracted brain growth\\n\\nThe pace of dental development of the Dikika infant was broadly comparable to that of chimpanzees and therefore faster than in modern humans. However, given that the brains of Australopithecus afarensis adults were roughly 20 percent larger than those of chimpanzees, the Dikika child\\'s small endocranial volume suggests a prolonged period of brain development relative to chimpanzees. \"Even a conservative comparison of the Dikika infant to small-statured and small-brained adults like Lucy, suggests that brain growth in Australopithecus afarensis was protracted as in humans today,\" explains Simon Neubauer.\\n\\n\"Our data show that Australopithecus afarensis had an ape-like brain organization, but suggest that these brains developed over a longer period of time than in chimpanzees,\" concludes Philipp Gunz. Among primates in general, different rates of growth and maturation are associated with different infant-care strategies, suggesting that the extended period of brain growth in Australopithecus afarensis may have been linked to a long dependence on caregivers. Alternatively, slow brain growth could also primarily represent a way to spread the energetic requirements of dependent offspring over many years in environments where food is not abundant. In either case the protracted brain growth in Australopithecus afarensis provided a basis for subsequent evolution of the brain and social behavior in hominins, and was likely critical for the evolution of a long period of childhood learning.', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403082853.htm', 'published': '2020-04-03T12:28:53', 'title': 'Scientists discover a new class of taste receptors', 'text': 'Evolution is a tinkerer, not an engineer. \"Evolution does not produce novelties from scratch. It works with what already exists,\" wrote Nobel laureate Fran√ßois Jacob in 1977, and biologists continue to find this to be true.\\n\\nCase in point: A team of scientists led by researchers at UC Santa Barbara has discovered that multiple opsin proteins, known for decades to be required for vision, also function as taste receptors. The finding, which appears in Current Biology, represents a light-independent function for opsins, and raises questions about the purpose these proteins served in ancient organisms.\\n\\n\"This is the first example of a role of opsins in taste, or in any form of chemical sensation,\" said coauthor Craig Montell, a distinguished professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology.\\n\\nScientists in the late 1800s discovered the light-sensing role of rhodopsin -- which consists of an opsin bound to retinal, a form of vitamin A -- and it has since become the most studied sensory receptor. Until recently, researchers believed that the family of rhodopsin proteins was involved only in light reception. However, in 2011, Montell and his colleagues found that an opsin enables the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to detect small temperature changes within its comfortable range.\\n\\nAnimals have many types of sensory proteins that respond to stimuli from the environment. Some require a strong stimulus, such as scalding heat, to activate. Rhodopsins are able to respond to very subtle changes or very low levels of stimuli -- like those in very dim light conditions -- and then initiate a molecular cascade that amplifies the signal, ultimately activating a sensory response.\\n\\nResearchers in Montell\\'s lab used aristolochic acid -- a toxic, bitter compound found in some plants -- to study taste receptors in fruit flies. High concentrations of this bitter chemical activate the flies\\' taste neurons by directly opening a channel protein called TRPA1, which lets calcium and sodium into the cells. This leads to a bitter taste the animals avoid. However, the flies also avoid even highly diluted aristolochic acid, which isn\\'t a strong enough signal to open the channels directly.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMontell and lead author Nicole Leung, who recently completed her predoctoral studies at UC Santa Barbara, suspected opsin molecules might be at work in detecting subtle chemical signals as well, via a signal amplification process.\\n\\nThey presented flies with a choice between sugar alone or sugar spiked with dilute aristolochic acid. Unsurprisingly, the flies rejected the sugar laced with the bitter chemical and ate the pure sugar.\\n\\nThe scientists then raised fruit flies with mutations that prevented them from synthesizing different opsin proteins. They found that flies with defects in any one of three types of opsins couldn\\'t detect the small concentrations of acid, and ate nearly equal amounts of the sugar laced with the bitter compound as the pure sugar. However, the mutant animals were still sensitive to large amounts of the bitter compound, which they continued to avoid. According to Montell, the large amounts of the bitter chemical directly activated the TRPA1 channel, which was still present in the flies missing the opsins.\\n\\nThe team showed that aristolochic acid activated these opsins by binding to the same site that retinal normally does in rhodopsin. Much like rhodopsins turned on by very dim light, the chemically-activated opsins then initiated a molecular cascade that amplified the small signals. This enabled the flies to detect concentrations of the compound that would otherwise be insufficient to trigger a response in their sensory neurons.\\n\\n\"Rhodopsins were discovered back in the 1870s,\" Montell said, \"so to discover that opsins have roles in taste after 150 years or so is pretty exciting.\"\\n\\nMontell speculates that chemoreception may have been the original role of opsin proteins. Chemical reception, he said, is a more basic requirement for life than is light reception. Knowing what to eat and what dangerous chemicals to avoid serves a more ancient survival function than does the ability to detect light. Perhaps by chance, he ventured, a retinal became bound to an opsin and conferred light sensitivity to the opsin.\\n\\nFollowing Montell\\'s 2011 discovery that opsins function in temperature sensation, another group found that opsins play a role in hearing in flies. Now, with the demonstration that opsins are taste receptors as well, Montell suspects they may be involved in still additional senses.\\n\\n\"In every case, they provide a mechanism for sensing low levels of stimuli by initiating an amplification cascade,\" he said.\\n\\nThe new finding likely extends beyond the fruit flies the scientists studied. \"The ramifications are that maybe opsins represent a new class of taste receptor in mammals, including humans,\" said Montell, a hypothesis the team is currently investigating.', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403082851.htm', 'published': '2020-04-03T12:28:51', 'title': 'Coastal pollution reduces genetic diversity of corals, reef resilience', 'text': 'A new study by researchers at the University of Hawai\\'i at M?noa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) found that human-induced environmental stressors have a large effect on the genetic composition of coral reef populations in Hawai\\'i.

We think of it as an innate intuition that sparks deep in the belly and helps guide our actions, if we let it.

Directed by the brainstem, these types of basic biological actions are largely automatic. But what if the higher brain -- the thinking, emotional centers -- were influenced by signals in the gut, too? New University of Illinois research in rats shows the entire brain responds to the gut, specifically the small intestine, through neuronal connections.\\n\\nTo map the connections, researchers inserted neuron-loving viruses in the rats\\' small intestines and traced the viruses as they moved from neuron to neuron along the Vagus and spinal nerves and throughout the brain. The idea was virus movement mimicked the movement of normal signals through neurons from the gut to the brain and back.\\n\\n\"We saw a lot of connections in the brainstem and hindbrain regions. We knew these regions are involved in sensing and controlling the organs of the body, so there weren\\'t any big surprises there.

They have all these multifaceted functions. So thinking about how information from the small intestine might be nudging those processes a little bit is really cool,\" says Coltan Parker, doctoral student in the Neuroscience Program at Illinois and lead author on a study published in Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical.\\n\\nThe study represents the first complete map of neuronal connections between the small intestine -- what Parker and his co-authors call an \"underloved\" part of the digestive system -- and the entire brain. The involvement of cognitive and emotional centers hints at how the thinking brain sometimes overrides our feeling of being full, provides fodder to explore relationships between depression and digestive troubles, and more.\\n\\n\"Now we\\'re actually finding the neuro-anatomy that might be involved in that \\'feeling in your gut,\\'\" says Megan Dailey, study co-author and program administrator in the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at Illinois.\\n\\nIn addition to showing just how extensive the connections are between the small intestine and the brain, the study uncovered a rarely documented feature of the neurons themselves.\\n\\nScientists have long assumed sensations from the gut, or anywhere in the body, traveled to the brain along one set of neurons (the sensory neurons), with instructions from the brain traveling back along a separate set of neurons (the motor neurons). But in their mapping study, Illinois researchers discovered some of the neurons -- about half -- were transmitting both sensory and motor signals.\\n\\nThey were capable of cross-talk within the same neuron.\\n\\n\"From the cortex to the brainstem, in pretty much every region we investigated, there was that 50% overlap of sensory-motor signals. It was throughout the brain, consistently,\" says study co-author Elizabeth Davis. Davis is a 2018 graduate of the Illinois Neuroscience Program and is currently studying as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Southern California.\\n\\nThe same pattern -- 50% of neurons having both sensory and motor signaling capabilities -- had only been shown one other time, in a study mapping neuronal connections between fat tissue and the brain. The researchers point out new evidence of the same crosstalk pattern could suggest a general architecture of neuronal networks between the body and brain.\\n\\n\"This study shows that sensorimotor feedback loops are abundant across all levels of the brain. Up until now, it has really been unknown how information in the small intestine, about nutrients or anything else, can get up to the brain and affect cognitive-emotional processes, and then how those processes can come back down and affect the gut,\" Parker says. \"With more research, we may finally begin to understand how hunger makes us \\'hangry,\\' or how a stressful day becomes an irritable bowel.\"', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200402155727.htm', 'published': '2020-04-02T19:57:27', 'title': 'Scientists show how parasitic infection causes seizures, psychiatric illness for some: Fralin Biomedical Research Institute scientists show how infection rewires brain', 'text': 'Think about traffic flow in a city -- there are stop signs, one-way streets, and traffic lights to organize movement across a widespread network.

Commonly passed to humans via exposure to farm animals, infected cat litter, or undercooked meat, the parasitic infection causes unnoticeable or mild, to flu-like symptoms in most healthy people. But for a small number of patients, these microscopic parasites hunker down inside of neurons, causing signaling errors that can result in seizures, personality and mood disorders, vision changes, and even schizophrenia.\\n\\n\"After the initial infection, humans will enter a phase of chronic infection. We wanted to examine how the brain circuitry changes in these later stages of parasitic cyst infection,\" said Michael Fox, a professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and the study\\'s lead author.\\n\\nThe parasite forms microscopic cysts tucked inside of individual neurons.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\"The theory is that neurons are a great place to hide because they fail to produce some molecules that could attract cells of the immune system,\" said Fox, who is also director of the research institute\\'s Center for Neurobiology Research.\\n\\nFox and his collaborator, Ira Blader, recently reported that long-term Toxoplasma infections redistribute levels of a key enzyme needed in inhibitory neurons to generate GABA, a neurotransmitter released at the specialized connection between two neurons, called a synapse.\\n\\nBuilding on that discovery, the scientists revealed that persistent parasitic infection causes a loss of inhibitory synapses, and they also observed that cell bodies of neurons became ensheathed by other brain cells, microglia. These microglia appear to prevent inhibitory interneurons from signaling to the ensheathed neurons.\\n\\n\"In neuropsychiatric disorders, similar patterns of inhibitory synapse loss have been reported, therefore these results could explain why some people develop these disorders post-infection,\" Fox said.\\n\\nFox said the inspiration for this study started years ago when he met Blader, a collaborating author and professor of microbiology and immunology at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, after he delivered a seminar at Virginia Tech. Blader studied Toxoplasma gondii and wanted to understand how specific strands of the parasite impacted the retina in mouse models.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nWorking together, the two labs found that while the retina showed no remarkable changes, inhibitory interneurons in the brain were clearly impacted by the infection. Mice -- similar to humans -- exhibit unusual behavioral changes after Toxoplasma infection. One hallmark symptom in infected mice is their tendency to approach known predators, such as cats, displaying a lack of fear, survival instincts, or situational processing.\\n\\n\"Even though a lot of neuroscientists study Toxoplasma infection as a model for immune response in the brain, we want to understand what this parasite does to rewire the brain, leading to these dramatic shifts in behavior,\" Fox said.\\n\\nFuture studies will focus on further describing how microglia are involved in the brain\\'s response to the parasite.\\n\\nAmong the research collaborators is Gabriela Carrillo, the study\\'s first author and a graduate student in the Translational Biology, Medicine, and Health Program.

Olive, PhD, associate professor of medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, member of the HICCC, and senior author of the study. \"Pancreatic cancer is a uniquely lethal disease, with an average survival rate of just six months after diagnosis. We\\'re in desperate need of new treatments.\"\\n\\nMost pancreatic tumors ramp up the production of oxidants that can kill many normal cells.

All cells, including pancreatic tumor cells, use cysteine to manufacture molecules that detoxify oxidants.\\n\\n\"Since pancreatic tumors appear to depend on cysteine import for their survival, we hypothesized that it might be possible to slow tumor growth by selectively targeting this amino acid,\" Olive said.\\n\\nThat strategy of starving the pancreatic cancer cells of cysteine worked. When the gene that controls cysteine import was knocked out in mice with pancreatic cancer closely resembling human tumors, cutting off the cancer\\'s supply of cysteine, the tumors stopped growing and median survival time doubled.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe researchers achieved similar results when the mice were treated with cysteinase -- an experimental drug that breaks down cysteine in blood. (Cysteinase is currently being developed by researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center for the treatment of cystinuria, a rare genetic disorder in which high levels of cysteine concentrate in the urine, causing kidney and urinary tract stones.)\\n\\nHuman pancreatic cancer cells also appear to be dependent on cysteine, the researchers found. When cysteinase was added to human pancreatic cancer cells in tissue culture, cancer cells died.\\n\\nRole of Ferroptosis in Pancreatic Cancer\\n\\nWhen starved of cysteine, the pancreatic cancers cells are killed by a process called ferroptosis, the researchers also found. Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that results from oxidation damage to cell membranes.

His laboratory also went on to link the protein to both cardiovascular disease and lung failure.\\n\\nWhile the COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread around the globe, the absence of a clinically proven antiviral therapy or a treatment specifically targeting the critical SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 on a molecular level has meant an empty arsenal for health care providers struggling to treat severe cases of COVID-19.\\n\\n\"Our new study provides very much needed direct evidence that a drug -- called APN01 (human recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 -- hrsACE2) -- soon to be tested in clinical trials by the European biotech company Apeiron Biologics, is useful as an antiviral therapy for COVID-19,\" says Dr. Art Slutsky, a scientist at the Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science of St. Michael\\'s Hospital and professor at the University of Toronto who is a collaborator on the study.\\n\\nIn cell cultures analyzed in the current study, hrsACE2 inhibited the coronavirus load by a factor of 1,000-5,000. In engineered replicas of human blood vessel and kidneys -- organoids grown from human stem cells -- the researchers demonstrated that the virus can directly infect and duplicate itself in these tissues. This provides important information on the development of the disease and the fact that severe cases of COVID-19 present with multi-organ failure and evidence of cardiovascular damage. Clinical grade hrsACE2 also reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these engineered human tissues.\\n\\n\"Using organoids allows us to test in a very agile way treatments that are already being used for other diseases, or that are close to being validated.

Four years ago, Hwang\\'s group reported an easy way to detach those delicate layers so they could be studied in new ways.\\n\\nOne of the researchers who worked on that study, Seung Sae Hong, led this one as well. He used the new method to create and free small pieces of LCMO that were thinner than ever before -- less than 20 nanometers thick.

At the center of the device is a ring of ice about three feet across and eight inches thick. Below the ring is a hydraulic press that can put as much as 100 tons of force on the ice and simulate the weight of a glacier 800 feet thick. Above the ring are motors that can rotate the ice at speeds of 1 to 10,000 feet per year.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe ice is surrounded by a tub of temperature-controlled, circulating fluid that keeps the ice ring right at its melting temperature so it slides on a thin film of water -- just like all fast-flowing glaciers.\\n\\nA $530,000 grant from the National Science Foundation supported development of the device. Iverson worked with three engineers from the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s Ames Laboratory -- Terry Herrman, Dan Jones and Jerry Musselman -- to turn his ideas into a working machine.\\n\\nAnd it has worked for about a decade, providing data on how glaciers move over rigid rock and deformable sediment.\\n\\nA drag on the ice\\n\\nFor the experiments that led to the new slip law, Zoet drove from Ames to Madison to fill six, 5-gallon buckets with real, glacially deposited sediment called till that had the right mix of mud, sand and larger rock particles.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe\\'d scoop that into the ring-shear device to make the till bed. He\\'d then construct an ice ring above it by freezing layers of water seeded with ice crystals. He\\'d apply force on the ice, heat it until it was melting and turn on the machine.\\n\\n\"We were after the mathematical relationship between the drag holding the ice back at the bottom of the glacier and how fast the glacier would slide,\" Iverson said. \"That included studying the effect of the difference between ice pressure on the bed and water pressure in the pores of the till -- a variable called the effective pressure that controls friction.\"\\n\\nThe data indicated the relationship between \"drag, slip velocity and effective pressure that is needed to model glacier flow,\" Iverson said.\\n\\n\"Glacier ice is a highly viscous fluid that slips over a substrate -- in this case a deformable till bed -- and friction at the bed provides the drag that holds the ice back,\" Iverson said. \"In the absence of friction, the weight of the ice would cause it to accelerate catastrophically like some landslides.\"\\n\\nBut it\\'s nearly impossible to get drag data in the field. Zoet said the act of drilling through the ice would change the interface between the glacier and bed, making measurements and data less accurate.\\n\\nSo Iverson built his laboratory device to collect that data, and Zoet has built a slightly smaller version for his Wisconsin laboratory. Zoet\\'s machine features a transparent sample chamber so researchers can see more of what\\'s happening during an experiment.\\n\\nThe resulting experimentally based slip law for glaciers moving over soft beds should make a difference in predictions of glacier movement and sea-level rise:\\n\\n\"Ice sheet models using our new slip relationship,\" Iverson said, \"would tend to predict higher ice discharges to the ocean -- and higher rates of sea-level rise -- than slip laws currently being used in most ice sheet models.\"', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200402144508.htm', 'published': '2020-04-02T18:45:08', 'title': 'COVID-19 vaccine candidate shows promise, research shows', 'text': 'University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine scientists today announced a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic.

The patch goes on like a Band-Aid and then the needles -- which are made entirely of sugar and the protein pieces -- simply dissolve into the skin.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\"We developed this to build on the original scratch method used to deliver the smallpox vaccine to the skin, but as a high-tech version that is more efficient and reproducible patient to patient,\" Falo said. \"And it\\'s actually pretty painless -- it feels kind of like Velcro.\"\\n\\nThe system also is highly scalable. The protein pieces are manufactured by a \"cell factory\" -- layers upon layers of cultured cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein -- that can be stacked further to multiply yield. Purifying the protein also can be done at industrial scale. Mass-producing the microneedle array involves spinning down the protein-sugar mixture into a mold using a centrifuge. Once manufactured, the vaccine can sit at room temperature until it\\'s needed, eliminating the need for refrigeration during transport or storage.\\n\\n\"For most vaccines, you don\\'t need to address scalability to begin with,\" Gambotto said. \"But when you try to develop a vaccine quickly against a pandemic that\\'s the first requirement.\"\\n\\nWhen tested in mice, PittCoVacc generated a surge of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the microneedle prick.\\n\\nThose animals haven\\'t been tracked long term yet, but the researchers point out that mice who got their MERS-CoV vaccine produced a sufficient level of antibodies to neutralize the virus for at least a year, and so far the antibody levels of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated animals seem to be following the same trend.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nImportantly, the SARS-CoV-2 microneedle vaccine maintains its potency even after being thoroughly sterilized with gamma radiation -- a key step toward making a product that\\'s suitable for use in humans.\\n\\nThe authors are now in the process of applying for an investigational new drug approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in anticipation of starting a phase I human clinical trial in the next few months.\\n\\n\"Testing in patients would typically require at least a year and probably longer,\" Falo said. \"This particular situation is different from anything we\\'ve ever seen, so we don\\'t know how long the clinical development process will take.

The study identified that the genes ABTB1 and GRB10 were both influential in nutrient sensing pathways and showed association to memory.\\n\\nAdvances in medicine and healthcare over the past century have led to increased life expectancies. However, ageing is still accompanied by frailty and a decline in our thought processes. This level of decline varies enormously across individuals and an improved understanding of what influences these ageing mechanisms could help develop strategies to increase \"healthspan,\" which is the period of time free from debilitating disease.\\n\\nPrevious studies have indicated that neural stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampal part of the brain play an important role in the decline of our thought process and memory over time. NSCs are cells that keep dividing as long as they are alive and either make more NSCs or cells that have a specialist function in the brain. The maintenance of these NSCs is important in memory and is affected by environmental factors such as diet and exercise, potentially explaining some of the variation in how ageing affects different people.\\n\\nAlthough the role of nutrient-sensing-pathways in ageing and the maintenance of stem cells in the brain has been investigated in animal models, no human studies have so far investigated their role in NSCs in the hippocampus.\\n\\nThe study aimed to explore whether nutrient-sensing pathways can provide the molecular basis for the association between lifestyle and ageing. These pathways have been implicated in stem cell maintenance, suggesting they could also be involved in the interaction between lifestyle, NSCs and cognition. Using a novel back-translation approach which uses laboratory-based experiments on NSCs to inform analysis of epidemiological data rather than vice versa the researchers showed that variations in ABTB1 are associated to performance on a standard memory task and that variation in the gene GRB10 is an important player in determining the association between Mediterranean diet and memory performance. The study also identified an interaction between exercise levels and the SIRT1 genotype which led to different performances on memory tasks.\\n\\nLead author, Chiara de Lucia, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN), King\\'s College London said: \\'Our study shows that nutrient-sensing pathways play an important role in memory and suggests that the ABTB1 and GRB10 genes are likely molecular links for the association between diet, the ageing of neural stem cells and our memory ability. Identifying these genes as the missing links between these three important variables could inform new approaches to help improve the ageing process through targeted changes in diet and exercise and ultimately in developing new drugs in the future.\\'\\n\\nSenior author, Sandrine Thuret from the IoPPN said: \\'Finding the means to prevent or slow down the processes that drive the decline of our thought processes during ageing is one of the great endeavours of the 21st century. To our knowledge this is one of the first studies looking at these relationships with human data and adopting this back-translation approach which uses lab-based experiments to inform research on large datasets, allowing for a more targeted approach.\\'\\n\\n\\'Our findings suggest that changes in lifestyle may be able to delay a decline in memory and thinking but that the effectiveness of these approaches will depend on the genetic makeup of each person. For example, adherence to a diet such as the Mediterranean diet may be most beneficial for people with a specific GRB10 mutation while increased exercise may be a better approach for participants with specific SIRT1 variations. Future research should look to replicate these findings on a larger dataset which would allow for the testing of 3-way interactions between diet, exercise and memory to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how these relate to one another.\\'\\n\\nResearchers analysed the molecular and genetic mechanisms by exposing human NSCs to serums from either young or old individuals and to chemicals whose effects mimic the ageing process. The genes identified from the in vitro analysis as important in nutrient-sensing-pathways were then associated with genetic data from over 2000 individuals from the TwinsUK cohort and data on performance on the Paired Associates Learning(PAL) task which assesses visual memory and learning, healthy eating, Mediterranean diet, calorie intake and physical activity.\\n\\nThe work was supported by a grant from the Medical Research Council', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200402144437.htm', 'published': '2020-04-02T18:44:37', 'title': '3D reconstructions of individual nanoparticles: Liquid phase electron microscopy illuminates 3D atomic structures of platinum nanoparticles, advancing full control of nanoengineering', 'text': 'Want to find out how to design and build materials atom by atom? A new liquid phase electron microscopy will advance full control of nanoengineering. Far more than that, nanotechnologists will say, in a new study published in the journal Science. Whether a material catalyzes chemical reactions or impedes any molecular response is all about how its atoms are arranged. The ultimate goal of nanotechnology is centered around the ability to design and build materials atom by atom, thus allowing scientists to control their properties in any given scenario. However, atomic imaging techniques have not been sufficient to determine the precise three-dimensional atomic arrangements of materials in liquid solution, which would tell scientists how materials behave in everyday life, such as in water or blood plasma.\\n\\nResearchers at the Center for Nanoparticle Research within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS, South Korea), in collaboration with Dr. Hans Elmlund at Monash University\\'s Biomedicine Discovery Institute in Australia and Dr. Peter Ercius at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\\'s Molecular Foundry in the USA, have reported a new analytic methodology that can resolve the 3D structure of individual nanoparticles with atomic-level resolution. The 3D atomic positions of individual nanoparticles can be extracted with a precision of 0.02 nm -- six times smaller than the smallest atom: hydrogen. In other words, this high-resolution method detects individual atoms and how they are arranged within a nanoparticle.\\n\\nThe researchers call their development 3D SINGLE (Structure Identification of Nanoparticles by Graphene Liquid cell Electron microscopy) and utilize mathematical algorithms to derive 3D structures from a set of 2D imaging data acquired by one of the most powerful microscopes on Earth. First, a nanocrystal solution is sandwiched in-between two graphene sheets which are each just a single atom thick. \"If a fish bowl were made of a thick material, it would be hard to see through it. Since graphene is the thinnest and strongest material in the world, we created graphene pockets that allow the electron beam of the microscope to shine through the material while simultaneously sealing the liquid sample,\" explains PARK Jungwon, one of the corresponding authors of the study (assistant professor at the School of Chemical and Biological Engineering in Seoul National University).\\n\\nThe researchers obtain movies at 400 images per second of each nanoparticle freely rotating in liquid using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM). The team then applies their reconstruction methodology to combine the 2D images into a 3D map showing the atomic arrangement. Locating the precise position of each atom tells researchers how the nanoparticle was created and how it will interact in chemical reactions.\\n\\nThe study defined the atomic structures of eight platinum nanoparticles -- platinum is the most valuable of the precious metals, used in a number of applications such as catalytic materials for energy storage in fuel cells and petroleum refinement. Even though all of the particles were synthesized in the same batch, they displayed important differences in their atomic structures which affect their performance.\\n\\n\"Now it is possible to experimentally determine the precise 3D structures of nanomaterials that had only been theoretically speculated. The methodology we developed will contribute to fields where nanomaterials are used, such as fuel cells, hydrogen vehicles, and petrochemical synthesis,\" says Dr. KIM Byung Hyo, the first author of the study. Notably, this methodology can measure the atomic displacement and strain on the surface atoms of individual nanoparticles. The strain analysis from the 3D reconstruction facilitates characterization of the active sites of nanocatalysts at the atomic scale, which will enable structure-based design to improve the catalytic activities. The methodology can also contribute more generally to the enhancement of nanomaterials\\' performance.\\n\\n\"We have developed a groundbreaking methodology for determining the structures that govern the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles at the atomic level in their native environment. The methodology will provide important clues in the synthesis of nanomaterials.

One of the simplest is the AND gate; it produces output only when one input AND another are present.\\n\\nFor example, when typing on a keyboard, pressing the Shift key AND the A key produces an uppercase letter A. Logic gates made from biological parts aim to bring this level of control into bioengineered systems.\\n\\nWith the right gates operating inside living cells, inputs such as the presence of two different molecules -- or one and not the other -- can cause a cell to produce a specific output, such as activating or suppressing a gene.\\n\\n\"The whole Apollo 11 Guidance Computer was built from electronic NOR gates,\" said lead author Zibo Chen, a recent UW graduate student. \"We succeeded in making protein-based NOR gates.

Healthy cells can go either way. Cancer cells\\' replication switches are stuck in the \\'on\\' position. Now a study by University of Colorado Cancer Center researchers working at CU Boulder\\'s BioFrontiers Institute and published today in the journal Science overturns the conventional wisdom of how these switches work -- a model accepted since 1974 and included in current textbooks.\\n\\nMany biological systems have evolved ways to adapt their reproductive behavior to their surroundings. Take wild jackdaws -- when ecosystem resources are limited, jackdaws hatch fewer eggs. Of course, jackdaws have to sense their ecosystems to make this adjustment. Cells do the same thing, with cell-surface receptors acting like tiny grasping hands reaching out into the ecosystem surrounding the cell to see what they can grab. When a specialized receptor/hand grabs a growth factor molecule it relays the signal inside the cell, telling the cell to initiate another pass through the cycle of cellular replication. When these growth factors are absent, cells enter a sleep-like state called quiescence.\\n\\nSince 1974, scientists have thought that cells make the decision to replicate or quiesce only in a short window during the phase of the cell cycle called G1, as if cells make their go/no-go decision based on a snapshot of their surroundings. The current study, by the lab of Sabrina Spencer, PhD, CU Cancer Center investigator and assistant professor in the CU Boulder Department Biochemistry, together with lead author Mingwei Min, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Spencer\\'s lab, shows that cells do not, in fact, depend on a snapshot to decide whether to replicate -- it\\'s more like a movie.\\n\\n\"Cells are continuously integrating the availability of growth factors,\" Spencer says. \"Since the environment is continuously fluctuating, it makes sense that cells would continuously sense their surroundings throughout the cell cycle to enable them to adapt appropriately.\"\\n\\nBut don\\'t blame scientists of the 70s. The snapshot-vs-movie misunderstanding is a function old-vs-new technology. In the 1970s, scientists couldn\\'t see single live cells and instead had to study populations of cells. To look at how growth factors affect cell proliferation, scientists had to synchronize cells by taking away growth factors to force them into quiescence, and then add growth factors back to see if they could initiate replication. What they found is a \"restriction point\" at which time taking away growth factors would no longer stop replication -- making it seem as if growth factor sensing occurs only right before the restriction point in G1.\\n\\nSpencer is a pioneer in the use of a new technology called single-cell microscopy. Basically, she can watch a single, live cell as it goes about its business. This means that she no longer has to synchronize a population of cells and can instead watch how single cells within a messy population of cells spanning the replication cycle react to these growth factors.\\n\\n\"The biochemistry of what people previously discovered is correct, but the timing is not,\" she says. The synchronization performed in earlier experiments wipes out cells\\' previous experience of growth factors -- like pushing a reset button -- and then providing growth factors to these reset cells made it seem as if they only sense growth factors before the restriction point in G1 phase of the current cell cycle. But Spencer didn\\'t need to synchronize cells and so didn\\'t need push reset by restricting growth factors.\\n\\nWhat she saw is that cells remember.\\n\\nSpencer found that cells sense growth factors throughout their previous cell cycle, such that taking away growth factors for one hour early in the previous cell cycle results in a lower percentage of cells choosing to launch back into replication 15 hours later.\\n\\n\"Cells are continuously taking stock of not only present growth factor signaling but past growth factor signaling, as well,\" Spencer says. \"Normally 80 percent of cells commit to replication, but with a one-hour lapse in growth factors, you\\'re down to 65 percent, with three-hour lapse you\\'re down to 40 percent, and with a six-hour lapse you\\'re down to only 10-20 percent making the decision to reenter the cell cycle. From a basic science point of view, this means they have a memory.\"\\n\\nThis memory seems linked to a cell\\'s rate of protein production. When Spencer removed growth factors, protein production was drastically reduced, and along with it, the production of an important protein called Cyclin D, which in large part controls the entry into the cell cycle. With lower Cyclin D (also a major target for anti-cancer medicines), fewer cells chose to replicate.\\n\\n\"We think the basic science is pretty exciting. And in addition, the good news in the context of cancer is that cells are continuously sensitive to growth factor signaling -- for example, in a disease like melanoma, you wouldn\\'t have to only hit cells in G1 to block that cycle,\" Spencer says. \"Understanding when cells care about receiving those signals, and when cells are sensitive to drugs that block these signals, can fine tune how people utilize those drugs.\"', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200402144430.htm', 'published': '2020-04-02T18:44:30', 'title': 'The facial expressions of mice: The face of a mouse reveals its emotions', 'text': 'Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology are the first to describe different emotional facial expressions for mice. Similar to humans, the face of a mouse looks completely different when it tastes something sweet or bitter, or when it becomes anxious. With this new possibility to render the emotions of mice measurable, neurobiologists can now investigate the basic mechanisms of how emotions are generated and processed in the brain.\\n\\nPleasure, disgust, fear -- the facial expressions that reflect these emotions are the same in every human. For example, if we are disgusted by something, our eyes become narrower, our nose wrinkles, and our upper lip distorts asymmetrically. Even newborn babies react with distinct facial expressions when they are sad, happy or disgusted. We also think to recognize feelings in the facial expressions of our pets. In contrast, the faces of other animals can appear expressionless to us. This is wrong, as the Max Planck scientists now show.\\n\\nUsing machine vision, the researchers were able to reliably link five emotional states to the facial expressions of mice: pleasure, disgust, nausea, pain and fear were clearly distinguishable for the computer algorithms. They could even measure the relative strength of these emotions.\\n\\nJoyful expression\\n\\nThe study shows that the facial expression of a mouse is actually not just a reaction to the environment. It reflects the emotional value of the trigger. \"Mice that licked a sugar solution when they were thirsty showed a much more joyful facial expression than satiated mice,\" explains Nadine Gogolla, who led the study. Meanwhile, mice that tasted a slightly salty solution showed a \"satisfied\" expression, while a very salty solution led to a \"disgusted\" face. From these and other experiments, the researchers conclude that, uncoupled from the sensory stimulus, facial expressions actually reflect the inner, individual character of an emotion.\\n\\nEmotions, however, are not simply a reaction to an external stimulus -- they arise through mechanisms in the brain itself. The researchers thus investigated next, how neuronal activity in different brain regions affects the facial expressions. The neurobiologists were able to evoke different emotional facial expressions when they light-activated specific brain areas known to play a role in emotional processing.\\n\\nMechanisms behind emotions\\n\\nThe main benefit of the discovery of mouse facial expressions is that it is now possible to identify mechanisms giving rise to emotions. This, so far, was precisely the problem: without a reliable measurement of emotions, it has been difficult to study their origins in the brain. \"We humans may notice a subtle facial change in the mice, but we can only recognize the emotion behind it with a great deal of experience and can hardly ever determine its intensity,\" says Nejc Dolensek, the study\\'s lead author. \"With our automated face recognition system, we can now measure the intensity and nature of an emotion on a timescale of milliseconds and compare it to the neuronal activity in relevant brain areas.\" One such brain area is the insular cortex, which is associated with emotional behavior and the perception of emotions in animals and humans.\\n\\nWhen the scientists measured the activity of individual neurons using 2-photon microscopy and simultaneously recorded the emotional facial expressions of the mouse, something astonishing came to light: individual neurons of the insular cortex reacted with the same strength and at the exactly same time as the mouse\\'s facial expression. In addition, each individual neuron was linked to only one single emotion.\\n\\nThese results suggest the existence of \"emotion neurons,\" each reflecting a specific sensation -- at least in the insular cortex. \"By recording facial expressions, we can now investigate the fundamental neuronal mechanisms behind emotions in the mouse animal model,\" explains Nadine Gogolla. \"This is an important prerequisite for the investigation of emotions and possible disorders in their processing, such as in anxiety disorders or depression.\"', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200402144428.htm', 'published': '2020-04-02T18:44:28', 'title': \"Scientists develop 'backpack' computers to track wild animals in hard-to-reach habitats: Lightweight wireless network enables precise mapping of bats' social networks\", 'text': 'To truly understand an animal species is to observe its behavior and social networks in the wild.

Hence the team\\'s name for the network: Broadly Applicable Tracking System, or BATS.\\n\\nWhen Ripperger was pursuing his PhD a decade ago, he used a much more primitive system to study bats. He relied on radio-telemetry, sometimes running after the animals, tracking their flight path with an antenna in hand. At best, he might be able to calculate where they were every two minutes over a 30-meter area.\\n\\n\"It was a time-consuming, exhausting and inaccurate method,\" he said.\\n\\nWith funding from the German equivalent of the National Science Foundation, the grant\\'s principal investigators at the Museum of Natural History in Berlin and a number of German universities assembled an interdisciplinary team and set out to make a better system. Ripperger was a postdoc at the time at the natural history museum, and is still a visiting scientist there.\\n\\nThe work took about seven years, with computer scientists writing code from scratch to come up with the highest-performance network possible using ultra-low levels of energy. The capacity of each battery that powers the network amounts to about 5 percent of a AAA battery\\'s capacity.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe network consists of the tiny computers -- accelerometers producing data when the bats are moving and proximity sensors to show when they are close to each other -- all encased in each 3D-printed plastic backpack that weighs less than a penny. A series of base stations on the ground pick up signals and record data on bats\\' social activities and flight trajectories. The components are asleep most of the time, waking up when they receive a signal from another bat and then broadcasting every two seconds.\\n\\n\"One key advantage of our system is these wake-up receivers. They are in energy-saving mode and only wake up when they receive a signal from another bat, and then they are shouting, \\'I\\'m here, I\\'m here!\\' and there\\'s another receiver that comes into full consciousness and exchanges data,\" Ripperger said. \"That\\'s one way we conserve power consumption.\"\\n\\nDespite the low power, the network produced robust results in various studies of different species of bats. A two-week test in which 50 vampire bats were tagged produced data on almost 400,000 individual meetings. Researchers can download all the data from the system onto their phones in the field.\\n\\nRipperger described BATS and GPS, the most commonly used method for tracking animals on a grander scale, as highly complementary systems, with BATS able to collect signals in places where GPS cannot.\\n\\n\"If you want to study social behavior, once a bat enters a cave or tree trunk, a GPS logger doesn\\'t give us information because the signal from the satellite gets interrupted. But inside the roost is where all the social behavior is happening,\" he said. \"These are really two different approaches to studying animal behavior.\"\\n\\nThere is a definite novelty to learning about how vampire bats interact, but the research also has shown remarkable similarities between their social behavior and certain aspects of human relationships. Using this system to tag vampire bats and the cattle they feed on can also help scientists better understand the spread of rabies, Ripperger said. He and colleagues are currently designing a conservation study to tag protected sand lizards living near railway lines in Germany to determine how track maintenance affects their movement.\\n\\nThis work was supported by the German Research Foundation, a Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Studies Grant and a National Geographic Society Research Grant.\\n\\nGerald Carter of Ohio State co-authored the study.

COVID-19 statistics, especially the number of reported cases, are not at all like that. The data, at best, is highly incomplete, and often the tip of the iceberg for much larger problems. And data on tests and the number of reported cases is highly nonrandom. In many parts of the world today, health authorities are still trying to triage the situation with a limited number of tests available. Their goal in testing is often to allocate scarce medical care to the patients who most need it ‚Äî rather than to create a comprehensive dataset for epidemiologists and statisticians to study.\\n\\nBut if you‚Äôre not accounting for testing patterns, it can throw your conclusions entirely out of whack. You don‚Äôt just run the risk of being a little bit wrong: Your analysis could be off by an order of magnitude. Or even worse, you might be led in the opposite direction of what is actually happening. A country where the case count is increasing because it‚Äôs doing more testing, for instance, might actually be getting its epidemic under control. Alternatively, in a country where the reported number of new cases is declining, the situation could actually be getting worse, either because its system is too overwhelmed to do adequate testing or because it‚Äôs ramping down on testing for PR reasons.\\n\\nFailure to account for testing strategies can also render comparisons between states and countries meaningless. According to two recent epidemiological studies, which tried to infer the true number of infected people from the reported number of deaths, there is roughly a 20-fold difference in case detection rates between the countries that are doing the best job of it, such as Norway and the worst job, such as the United Kingdom. (The United States is probably somewhere in the middle of the pack by this standard.) That means, for example, that in one country that reports 1,000 COVID-19 cases, there could actually be 5,000 infected people, and in another country that reports 1,000 cases, there might be 100,000!\\n\\nThere is also a lot of uncertainty about the true numbers of infections within a given country. According to an expert survey published by FiveThirtyEight, the number of detected cases in the United States could underestimate the true number of infected people by anywhere from a multiple of two times to 100 times. The same holds in other countries. A recent paper published by Imperial College London estimated that the true number of people who had been infected with the coronavirus in the U.K. as of March 30 was somewhere between 800,000 and 3.7 million ‚Äî as compared to a reported case count through that date of just 22,141.\\n\\nSo in this article, I‚Äôm going to work through four examples of how various testing strategies can skew case counts, in the hopes of giving you a more hands-on sense for how the mechanics behind the numbers work. These scenarios are definitely not meant as predictions of what will happen in any given country, state or region. They work with hypothetical data, because we don‚Äôt know all the parameters we‚Äôd need to properly estimate a model anyway. The goal is just to illustrate, given relatively simple assumptions, how reported case counts for a disease can differ from the actual number of infections.\\n\\nAt the same time, the parameters in each scenario reflect what I hope are semi-realistic assumptions that at least loosely approximate the coronavirus situation in different groups of countries. Some countries have relatively robust testing. Some started out with strong testing but then stalled out. Some were way behind on testing but soon caught up. Each of these can have different effects on the pattern of reported cases.\\n\\nYou can even download an Excel spreadsheet and input your own assumptions ‚Äî though I‚Äôm going to wait until the end of the story to give you the link, in the hopes that you‚Äôll continue reading about how this all works before trying to brew up your own scenario.\\n\\nThe not-so-simple math behind coronavirus testing\\n\\nThe core purpose of this exercise is to help you think through how many people might test positive for a disease based on how many people are actually infected with it, given various assumptions about testing. That does require us to make some simple assumptions about the underlying number of infected people in the population. So the scenarios are partly based on what should be a fairly simple, standard epidemiological model.\\n\\nThe most important number in any epidemiological model is R, or the reproduction ratio, which is how many people that a person in one generation passes the disease along to in the next generation. For example, if a disease has an R of 3, that means each infected person transmits it to three more people. So one initial case becomes three newly infected people in the next generation, which becomes nine people, which becomes 27 people, which becomes 81 people, and so forth ‚Äî the very nature of exponential growth is that it gets out of hand quickly!\\n\\nAssumptions about the R of COVID-19 vary, and to some extent that‚Äôs inevitable given that there isn‚Äôt necessarily one intrinsic number for how the disease spreads from one infected person to the next. In fact, epidemiologists make a distinction between R0 (pronounced R-zero or R-naught), which is called the basic reproduction ratio, or how fast the disease spreads in the absence of any interventions or any immunity whatsoever, and the effective reproduction ratio, called R-effective or simply R. R-effective is likely to be much higher on a cruise ship or in a college dormitory than in the middle of a remote town in Alaska where people rarely encounter one another, for example. Moreover, interventions such as social distancing are being undertaken to bring down R, although actions can vary from location to location. The goal, though, is to get R below 1, which means that a disease begins to die out in a population. (It will die out gradually if R is close to 1 and quickly if it‚Äôs close to zero, say, 0.2.) Finally, if a disease has spread very widely throughout the population, R may eventually fall because of herd immunity. In other words, enough people are immune to a disease because they‚Äôve already had it, it will not continue to spread as fast.\\n\\nSo in these scenarios, I assume that R goes through three different stages that reflect various efforts at containment:\\n\\nFirst, there‚Äôs an uncontrolled stage where the disease is spreading unchecked throughout the population. I assume this stage has an R of 2.6. The WHO initially estimated R to be between 2.0 and 2.5, but other researchers such as those from Imperial College London have since revised their numbers upward to around 3.0; thus, 2.6 reflects something of a middle ground.\\n\\nwhere the disease is spreading unchecked throughout the population. I assume this stage has an of 2.6. The WHO initially estimated to be between 2.0 and 2.5, but other researchers such as those from Imperial College London have since revised their numbers upward to around 3.0; thus, 2.6 reflects something of a middle ground. Next, there‚Äôs an intermediate stage where some measures are being undertaken ‚Äî businesses are having their employees work from home, large events are cancelled, and people are avoiding some unnecessary contacts and generally being more careful. But, there are no lockdown or quarantine measures in place. I assume that R falls to 1.4 during this stage.\\n\\nwhere some measures are being undertaken ‚Äî businesses are having their employees work from home, large events are cancelled, and people are avoiding some unnecessary contacts and generally being more careful. But, there are no lockdown or quarantine measures in place. I assume that falls to 1.4 during this stage. Finally, there‚Äôs a lockdown stage where R falls to 0.7 ‚Äî or below zero, meaning that the disease begins to die out.\\n\\nThere‚Äôs a lot of disagreement about these values ‚Äî both how fast COVID-19 was spreading initially and how effective various interventions have been at lowering R. So you are welcome to download the spreadsheet at the end of this article and tweak those assumptions. (Note that the scenarios also account for R gradually reducing over time because of herd immunity, so the actual values of R in the scenarios may be slightly lower than the ones stated above.)\\n\\nNext: How long does a generation last? By a generation, I don‚Äôt mean the Baby Boomers or something like that ‚Äî I mean one round of infections. The number that determines the length of a generation is the serial interval, which is how long it takes, on average, for a person to transmit the disease to the people he infects. For COVID-19, estimates of the serial interval hover between four to five days. So I assume that a generation lasts five days in the scenarios.\\n\\nI also assume that the disease has varying levels of severity, and that this affects whether people are tested. In particular, I assume that:\\n\\n10 percent of cases are severe.\\n\\n60 percent of cases are mild.\\n\\nAnd 30 percent of cases are asymptomatic.\\n\\nAgain, this seems to match the consensus of the medical literature on COVID-19 ‚Ä¶ but there is a lot of disagreement about these parameters ‚Äî and especially on the number of asymptomatic cases. So I‚Äôd welcome you to input different values and see how they affect the results.\\n\\nHowever, in considering who gets tested, we also need to think about people who have symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 but who don‚Äôt actually have the coronavirus. I haven‚Äôt seen much research on this question, but thermometer data seems to find that around 3 percent of the U.S. population typically feels sick at this point in the year. So the scenarios assume that at any given time, 0.1 percent of the population has symptoms that resemble severe COVID-19 symptoms for reasons other than coronavirus (say, a bad flu or bronchitis or pneumonia), and that 2.5 percent have symptoms that resemble mild COVID-19 symptoms for other reasons than coronavirus (say, a mild flu or a bad cold). Furthermore, I assume that all people with severe symptoms seek testing (that is, they would get tested if they could), that half of people with mild symptoms do and that 2 percent of asymptomatic people do. All of these assumptions can also be changed in the spreadsheet.\\n\\nBut wait, there‚Äôs more! I don‚Äôt really consider the scenarios a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù in the way FiveThirtyEight usually uses that term because we‚Äôre not trying to predict anything, we‚Äôre just trying to show how different testing strategies can impact the number of reported cases. But, as in the case of real coronavirus models, there are an awful lot of messy, real-world problems we need to consider, too.\\n\\nOne of them is that there‚Äôs a long lag between when someone is infected, when they develop symptoms, when they get tested and when those test results are reported. In Wuhan, China, the lag between the development of symptoms and test results being reported was around 10 to 12 days. And considering it usually takes at least a few days for symptoms to develop, the lag between infection and a case showing up in the test statistics is going to be longer still. In these scenarios, I therefore assume that there‚Äôs a delay of 15 days (or three generations) between infection and the test results showing up in the data ‚Äî though if anything I suspect this is too generous, given the huge testing bottlenecks in places such as California.\\n\\nAnother real-world problem is that the tests aren‚Äôt perfect. In fact, according to reporting by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, around 30 percent of people who actually have COVID-19 test negative for it ‚Äî which is what we‚Äôd call a false negative. Other estimates of false negatives aren‚Äôt quite so high, so I assume a 20 percent false negative rate in the scenarios.\\n\\nThen, of course, there‚Äôs also the question of false positives, i.e., when a test reports that someone has COVID-19 but they actually don‚Äôt. This number is harder to pin down, but we can infer that tests rarely produce false positives. Why? In Iceland, where large numbers of asymptomatic people are being tested, the overall rate of positive tests among this group is slightly under 1 percent. Given that includes people who probably do have the coronavirus (since asymptomatic cases are fairly common), we can assume the rate of false positives is even lower ‚Äî for the purpose of the scenarios, we‚Äôll guess that it‚Äôs 0.2 percent.\\n\\nHowever, there‚Äôs a bit of a mathematical twist in calculating false positives. Even if false positives are rare, false positives may swamp true positives if the underlying incidence of a disease is low. Say, for instance, that in the early stages of an outbreak in a town of 100,000 people, 100 people or 0.1 percent of the population actually has the disease. If everyone gets tested, then there will be roughly 200 false positives (0.2 percent of the population) ‚Äî larger than the number of people who are actually sick! This is why some of the discourse around false positive tests is confusing. It can both be true that the rate of false positives is fairly low and that a high share of positive tests are false. For better or worse, this becomes less of an issue as new infections multiply; there are lots of real positives, so they no longer drown out the false positives.\\n\\nFinally, there are a further set of assumptions we have to make about how many tests are conducted and who gets tested. But those vary from scenario to scenario. So let‚Äôs work through the scenarios now:\\n\\nScenario 1: Robust growth in testing\\n\\nTo emphasize that these are hypothetical scenarios and to get you in an appropriately abstract mindset, I‚Äôm going to ask you to imagine that these scenarios occur in a country called Covidia, which has 10 million people and where the first infected person entered the country on Jan. 1 (although his case wasn‚Äôt detected until later).\\n\\nIn this first scenario, Covidia ‚Äî like most real-world countries ‚Äî is a little slow to undertake social distancing measures. They take some intermediate steps on March 1, by which time 183,000 people there have already been infected, though far fewer positive tests (just 439!) have been reported. On March 16, with the number of cases still rapidly increasing, Covidia implements a full stay-at-home order (what I‚Äôm informally calling a ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù), which reduces R to less than one.\\n\\nIn better news, the testing situation is comparatively good in this version of Covidia. In this scenario, I assume that Covidia starts out with the capacity to do 1,000 tests per generation, and beginning in early February, it improves testing volume by 50 percent per generation until all testing demand is satisfied. I further assume that Covidia rations 75 percent of tests, meaning that tests go to people with severe symptoms before people with mild symptoms, and to people with mild symptoms before people with no symptoms. The remaining 25 percent of tests are available on an on-demand basis.\\n\\nSo, what does this look like? Here is how the actual number of infections compares to the number of reported cases in Covidia, first in table form‚Ä¶\\n\\nCovidia Scenario 1: Robust testing Testing capacity starts at 1,000 tests, but then increases by 50 percent per generation until all demand is met. Most tests are reserved for people with symptoms but some are available on-demand.

Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.\\n\\n‚Ä¶and then in chart form:\\n\\nThere are quite a few things to look at here. The most obvious and probably the most important one is simply that a 15-day delay between when someone gets infected and when their case shows up in the data as a positive test makes a huge difference. Even if everything else was going perfectly ‚Äî 100 percent of the population was being tested and the tests are 100 percent accurate ‚Äî with an R of 2.6, a 15-day delay would result in there being about 18 times more newly infected people in the population than the number of newly reported positive tests at any given time.\\n\\nThe delay matters less as R declines because if the disease isn‚Äôt growing as fast, there aren‚Äôt as many new people who get infected in the 15-day period between infection and test results. But it still means we‚Äôre always looking two weeks into the past whenever ‚Äúnew‚Äù data is reported. And remember, social distancing measures that are effective in flattening the curve may take two or three weeks to show up in the data. This is especially so when the demand for testing is near its peak and there are likely to be longer lags in processing test results.\\n\\nNext, even with relatively good testing, you‚Äôre still likely to miss many cases. By the end of the scenario on June 29, 1.2 million people have been infected at some point in Covidia, but there are only 186,000 detected cases, for a detection rate of about 16 percent (and some of those are false positives so the actual situation is a bit worse than that). What accounts for the missing cases?\\n\\nFirst, we assume that many people with mild symptoms or no symptoms do not want to get tested (and nobody forces them to get tested) so they get infected at some point without ever realizing it.\\n\\nNext, the 20 percent false negative rate means that some cases are missed.\\n\\nFinally, even where testing ramps up quickly, it may not ramp up quite as fast as the disease itself. The actual peak in new infections in this scenario comes on March 16 ‚Äî and at that point, testing is not fully scaled up and a lot of people who would like a test still cannot get one.\\n\\nThere‚Äôs also a third issue: If testing is increasing, the rate of growth of a disease can be overestimated. Alternatively, if testing is stagnant or decreasing, the rate of growth can be underestimated. Note that in Scenario 1, the R you‚Äôd infer from the number of reported cases peaks at 3.5, when the actual R based on infections was not quite as high (2.6 before Covidia began implementing social distancing measures).\\n\\nIn other words, the rapid rates of growth in new cases you can see in a country (say, Germany) when it first gets serious about testing are both a function of the number of tests increasing and the number of infections increasing ‚Äî and it‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs what. You can also have problems if there‚Äôs a sudden, one-off increase in tests, as we‚Äôll see in the next scenario.\\n\\nA final issue ‚Äî I‚Äôm not going to boldface it because it‚Äôs less important than the others ‚Äî is that in the late stages of the scenario when there is little disease transmission following a prolonged lockdown, many of the newly detected ‚Äúcases‚Äù are false positives. As I mentioned, false positives can be an issue to contend with when the overall incidence of disease in a population is low. They are not the greatest concern in the U.S. or Europe right now, when we‚Äôre still in the peak of the pandemic.\\n\\nScenario 2: Sudden, one-time increase in testing\\n\\nWhat would a more rapid increase in testing look like? In Scenario 2, I‚Äôm leaving all the settings from Scenario 1 unchanged ‚Äî except for the number of tests. In this new scenario, I assume that Covidia starts out with the capacity to conduct only 100 tests per generation, but then goes on a crash program in February and rapidly increases that number at a rate of 200 percent per generation until it maxes out at 100,000 tests about a month later. This is similar to the situation in the United States, where testing started out slow, improved rapidly and has now stalled out again.\\n\\nIn this scenario, the distortions between the number of infections and the number of people who test positive are more profound. Even though the actual R is ‚Äúonly‚Äù 2.6 in the early stages ‚Äî still a very scary, high number by the way ‚Äî it will briefly appear to be as high as 7.8 if you‚Äôre looking at the number of newly detected cases because test capacity is scaling up so rapidly.\\n\\nCovidia Scenario 2: Rapid, one-time testing increase Testing capacity starts at 100 tests, but then rapidly increases over a period of 4-5 weeks before maxing out at 100,000 tests. Most tests are reserved for people with symptoms but some are available on-demand.

Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.\\n\\nAnd on a graph, the slope will look extremely steep for a few weeks. You might be tempted to look at a graph like this and say that Covidia is on a much worse trajectory than other countries:\\n\\nBut that isn‚Äôt getting the story right. What really happened was: Covidia was way behind on testing and it‚Äôs playing catch-up, which means that the number of reported cases will increase at very fast rates until it does catch up. But the actual number of infections at any given time is the same as in Scenario 1. That doesn‚Äôt mean the news in Scenario 2 is good, exactly. It means Covidia had a very big COVID-19 problem all along that wasn‚Äôt being detected until very recently, but it is now finally starting to get its arms around it.\\n\\nNext, let‚Äôs look at the opposite case: Where testing starts out reasonably strong, but doesn‚Äôt scale up very much.\\n\\nScenario 3: High test floor, low test ceiling\\n\\nIn this scenario, I assume that Covidia starts out with up to 10,000 tests available per generation. However, it scales up tests very slowly (by just 3 percent per generation) before eventually capping out at 20,000 tests per generation. Furthermore, 100 percent of tests are reserved for symptomatic individuals and there are no on-demand tests available. This situation is broadly analogous to some European countries with centralized, socialized health care systems. For instance, the U.K. has tested only about 160,000 people total as of Apr. 2, or an average of only about 7,000 tests per day since March 19.\\n\\nIn this case, the number of cases is substantially underestimated because there aren‚Äôt enough tests at the peak of the epidemic.

Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.\\n\\nBut not only is the number of cases underestimated ‚Äî the rate of increase will also be underestimated. For instance, in this scenario, R appears to peak in the low-to-mid 2‚Äôs when it‚Äôs actually 2.6. This is because the rate of new cases is increasing faster than the country‚Äôs ability to detect them, even if the country rations as many of the tests as it can so it can test the sickest individuals, as we assume that it does. During the peak of the epidemic in Scenario 3, as many as 58 percent of newly reported tests will produce positive results, which resembles the extremely high rate of reported positives for periods of time in places such as Lombardy, Italy.\\n\\nSo while the slope of reported new cases in Scenario 3 might look more gentle than in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2‚Ä¶\\n\\n‚Ä¶the country‚Äôs situation is actually just as bad. And in some respects it might be worse. Having conducted so few tests, Covidia will miss some extremely ill people in Scenario 3 and they may die as a result of not being able to get medical care soon enough.\\n\\nThat‚Äôs not the worst-case scenario, though. Imagine if a country, recognizing that the media tends to fixate on case counts, decides that it can make things look superficially better by decreasing the number of tests that it does.\\n\\nScenario 4: A testing decrease\\n\\nLet‚Äôs say that, as in Scenario 3, Covidia starts out with the capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per generation. However, as the case count begins to accelerate, the government panics that the outbreak will make it look bad, so it subtly starts scaling down testing capacity by 20 percent per generation in early March. Meanwhile, being in denial about the scale of the problem, it doesn‚Äôt implement a full lockdown until April 10, or more than three weeks later than under the other scenarios.\\n\\nI should note that this is more of a ‚Äúthought experiment‚Äù than the other three scenarios. Countries from China to Russia to Iran have been accused of publishing unreliable official statistics ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt know whether any countries are deliberately limiting testing to keep case counts down.\\n\\nNonetheless, a situation like this obviously turns out quite badly. Almost 30 percent of the country eventually gets infected:\\n\\nCovidia Scenario 4: Testing declines to conceal outbreak Testing capacity starts at 10,000 tests, but gradually decreases in the midst of the outbreak. The government also waits several additional weeks to declare a full lockdown. All tests are rationed so people with more severe symptoms are given priority.

Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.\\n\\nWould the country really wait so long to implement a lockdown? Well, if it wasn‚Äôt doing enough testing, it might. Because Covidia is reducing the number of tests in this scenario, the number of reported new cases will appear to peak on March 16, even though the actual peak of new infections won‚Äôt come until April 5. It will appear that the partial measures it undertook worked, when really they weren‚Äôt working well enough:\\n\\nIn an instance like this, having information on the number of tests would be quite useful, as a high rate of positive tests could be a sign that you‚Äôre only seeing the tip of the iceberg. During the peak of the outbreak in April, as many as 64 percent of tests would return positive results in Scenario 4, the number would be as high as 80 percent if not for false negatives.\\n\\nI already gave away the conclusion at the top of the story, so I‚Äôm just going to repeat it once more, hoping that this article has helped to convince you of it: The number of reported COVID-19 cases is not a very useful indicator of anything unless you also know something about how tests are being conducted.\\n\\nIn fact, in some cases, places with lower nominal case counts may actually be worse off. In general, a high number of tests is associated with a more robust medical infrastructure and a more adept government response to the coronavirus. The countries that are doing a lot of testing also tend to have low fatality rates ‚Äî not just low case fatality rates (how many people die as a fraction of known cases) but also lower rates of death as a share of the overall population. Germany, for example, which is conducting about 50,000 tests per day ‚Äî seven times more than the U.K. ‚Äî has more than twice as many reported cases as the U.K., but they‚Äôve also had only about one-third as many deaths.\\n\\nPut another way: Doing more tests is good, and likely leads to better long-run outcomes, even if it also results in higher case counts that people will freak out about in the short run. I don‚Äôt usually like to be so didactic, but I hope you‚Äôll be a more educated consumer of COVID-19 data instead of just looking at case counts ticking upward on cable news screens without context. That context includes not only reporting about the amount of testing, but also indications such as hospital strain, which are more robust since they aren‚Äôt subject to as many vagaries about how tests are conducted. Even if you‚Äôre not from New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs daily briefings are worth watching because they do the best job I‚Äôve seen of providing this context.\\n\\nAnd if you do want to play with your own scenarios to see how all of this works‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs the link to that Excel sheet.

That‚Äôs one reason we‚Äôve been following a weekly survey of infectious disease researchers from institutions around the United States.\\n\\nThis week‚Äôs survey, taken on March 30 and 31, shows that experts expect an average of 263,000 COVID-19-related deaths in 2020, but anywhere between 71,000 and 1.7 million deaths is a reasonable estimate. The researchers believe that only about 12 percent of all COVID-19 infections in the U.S. have been reported, and they don‚Äôt expect that the daily number of reported cases in New York state ‚Äî which was most recently 7,917 ‚Äî will drop below 1,000 until around the end of April.\\n\\nThe survey collects each expert‚Äôs best estimate for each question, as well as their best-case and worst-case estimates. From those individual responses, the survey organizers ‚Äî Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ‚Äî build a probabilistic consensus forecast, which is a tool that combines all of the responses to project the most likely future scenario as well as the range of possible outcomes.\\n\\nEach expert‚Äôs answers contribute to the consensus forecast equally. This week, McAndrew and Reich explored the possibility of weighting experts based on their accuracy in past surveys, but they decided against it. ‚ÄúThe performance of individual experts has varied from week to week, and we haven‚Äôt found a benefit to using different weights for each expert to build more accurate consensus distributions,‚Äù they said.\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what the researchers said this past week.\\n\\nWhat is the smallest, most likely and largest number of total cases that The COVID Tracking Project will report on April 5?\\n\\nWhen the survey was sent out on March 30, The COVID Tracking Project was reporting about 141,000 COVID-19 cases in the U.S. The survey asked how many total cases will be reported on April 5, and even just a week out, there was a great deal of uncertainty in many of the experts‚Äô forecasts.\\n\\nMary Bushman, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University‚Äôs Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, said much of the uncertainty in case counts is related to the availability of testing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to know whether testing capacity will continue to increase and keep pace with increasing numbers of infections.‚Äù\\n\\nThe expert consensus suggests that about 387,000 cases will be reported on April 5, with a 90 percent chance of between 256,000 and 643,000 cases being reported. Last week, the consensus forecast predicted around 117,000 cases as of Sunday, March 29, and there turned out to be about 139,000.\\n\\nHow many people will die in the U.S. due to COVID-19 this year?\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx ‚Äî members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force ‚Äî estimated that COVID-19 could kill 100,000 to 240,000 Americans even if all federal guidelines are followed closely. But the surveyed experts aren‚Äôt assuming those guidelines will be followed, which helps explain their higher consensus forecast of 263,000 deaths and their high-end estimate of 1.7 million deaths.\\n\\n‚ÄúI think we can be reasonably confident that most of the U.S. will remain under some social or physical distancing directives for at least the next few weeks,‚Äù Bushman said. ‚ÄúBut there is significant uncertainty over how well people will comply with these directives and how much they actually reduce transmission, considering all of the activities that are exempted as essential.‚Äù\\n\\nIn the three weeks we‚Äôve been tracking the survey, the number of forecasted deaths has increased from 200,000 to 263,000.\\n\\nHow many total COVID-19 infections were actually in the U.S. on March 30?\\n\\nAlthough the The COVID Tracking Project reported about 141,000 total U.S. cases on Monday, the experts think the number of infections ‚Äî symptomatic or asymptomatic ‚Äî in the U.S. was much higher.\\n\\nThey believe there were between 289,000 and 12.8 million infections, with 1.1 million being the consensus estimate, implying that the experts think that only about 12 percent of all infections have been reported. This is in line with what they‚Äôve reported for the past three weeks, when the share of reported infections has ranged between 9 percent and 12 percent.\\n\\nWhen will New York state report fewer than 1,000 new daily cases of COVID-19?\\n\\nOn April 1, 7,917 new cases were reported in New York state, and that daily number has been increasing steadily for weeks.\\n\\nThe experts were asked when they thought the number of daily reported cases would drop below 1,000, assuming that work from home restrictions remain in place. The majority think it will happen sometime in April, but some experts think it‚Äôs possible that won‚Äôt happen until July.\\n\\nThe consensus forecast is that the number of new cases in New York state will drop below 1,000 around April 28, but any date between April 9 and June 9 is a reasonable estimate.\\n\\nThis week, the survey also asked each expert to report the proportion of their responses that comes from experience and intuition rather than from hard models built by themselves or other researchers. On average, 68 percent of each expert‚Äôs responses are coming from experience and intuition, with the other 32 percent coming from models.\\n\\nThat a group of expert infectious disease modelers is relying more on their experience and intuition than on hard models is yet more evidence that building a COVID-19 model is a huge, huge challenge.', 'author': ['Jay Boice']}, {'link': 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-easy-to-overhype-new-coronavirus-discoveries/', 'published': '2020-04-02T16:21:51', 'title': 'It‚Äôs Easy To Overhype New COVID-19 Discoveries', 'text': 'When it comes to the novel coronavirus, few data points are as reliable as they might appear. Whether it‚Äôs the total number of people infected, the fatality rate, or even which drugs might show therapeutic promise ‚Äî uncertainty confounds our understanding. Things are seldom as straightforward as we would like them to be.\\n\\nThe latest example of this dynamic came on Tuesday, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new data about how underlying health conditions can affect individuals‚Äô response to COVID-19. At first glance, the report suggested that people with those health conditions ‚Äî such as diabetes, chronic lung disease and heart disease ‚Äî were at a higher risk for severe disease or death from COVID-19. That finding is consistent with more anecdotal studies of COVID-19 patients in both China and Italy.\\n\\nBut as you go deeper into the data, the limitations of the finding become more clear. As of March 28, the CDC had collected data for 7,162 COVID-19 positive patients that included information on whether they had underlying health conditions or other known risk factors. That is just 5.8 percent of the 122,653 total U.S. COVID-19 cases reported to the CDC as of that time. But the size of the data set isn‚Äôt the biggest concern. The biggest concern is that we don‚Äôt know whether that subset is representative of the population of infected individuals. Without that, we don‚Äôt know whether the findings are representative, either.\\n\\nIn that subset of 7,162 cases, 37.6 percent of people had one or more underlying conditions. The CDC looked at three outcomes ‚Äî hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit and death ‚Äî and calculated which percentage in each outcome had comorbidities. (There were also 525 people for whom hospitalization status was unknown.) They found that 71 percent of those hospitalized, and 78 percent of ICU patients, had one or more underlying conditions, compared to only 27 percent of those who weren‚Äôt hospitalized. They also found that of the 184 deaths in the sample, 173 (94 percent) had at least one underlying condition.\\n\\nThose are highly suggestive numbers when taken out of context. And, sure enough, a few headlines did: ‚ÄúMore than 70% of Americans hospitalized with COVID-19 had at least 1 underlying health condition,‚Äù wrote Business Insider. ‚ÄúNearly 80% of US intensive-care cases have underlying conditions,‚Äù wrote Nature, one of the world‚Äôs premier scientific journals.\\n\\nA more accurate headline might be: ‚ÄúNearly 80 percent of a likely unrepresentative group of COVID-19 patients who went into intensive care had underlying conditions.‚Äù\\n\\nNot quite the same effect, is it?\\n\\nThe CDC is transparent about the limitations of its data set, including the potential selection bias. Because the sample of patients the CDC looked at wasn‚Äôt randomly selected, the 94.2 percent of COVID-19 patients with no underlying health data can‚Äôt be assumed to be similar to those for whom that data exists. The fact that this group isn‚Äôt representative of the whole set of COVID-19 patients means that we can‚Äôt assume that any of the statistics based on the 5.8 percent sample holds true for all patients. In some cases, these 5.8 percent may be more likely to be severe cases, and might be both more likely to have underlying conditions in the first place and more likely to have outcomes such as hospitalization, intensive care or death. But the authors also note that reporting occurred too early to fully capture all of the outcomes ‚Äî meaning that some patients, both with and without comorbidities, might still experience worsening outcomes, which would also change the conclusions. We won‚Äôt know for sure unless we have better data.\\n\\nWe reached out to the CDC researchers to ask why data on underlying conditions and comorbidities were so hard to get, but they did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It appears that at least some of the missing data can be explained by a lack of time. The authors indicate that the ‚Äúreporting burden associated with rapidly rising case counts and delays in completion of information requiring medical chart review‚Äù are most to blame.\\n\\nThe limitations of this data don‚Äôt change what we should all know by now: Those with underlying conditions should still be especially careful about contracting the disease. And just because this data set isn‚Äôt perfect doesn‚Äôt mean it has nothing to say: Especially since it seems in accordance with previous studies, it does suggest people with underlying conditions are at increased risk.

Isn‚Äôt that a better place to be with a crowd than, say, a movie theater?\\n\\n‚ÄúThe higher number of people close together, the higher the likelihood that you‚Äôll get something, no matter if you‚Äôre indoors or outdoors,‚Äù said Dr. Kartik Patel, a primary care doctor with UCHealth in Colorado.\\n\\nOh.\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as many public health officials recommend keeping a distance of at least 6 feet from other people when you leave your home, including visiting public outdoor spaces. (And one MIT professor has wondered whether 6 feet is far enough.) While that seems fairly straightforward on paper, in practice it can get confusing quickly. If you‚Äôre jogging down the street and start approaching a neighbor walking in the opposite direction, for example, should you cross to the other side?\\n\\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve been crossing the street,‚Äù said Carolyn Cannuscio, a social epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Center for Public Health Initiatives. ‚ÄúI know that offends people sometimes. Someone called me out the other day and said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going to give you the virus!‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm an epidemiologist.‚Äô‚Äù\\n\\nOther experts I spoke to felt the risk of merely passing by someone on the street is minimal, but that the more contact you come into with people ‚Äî no matter where it is ‚Äî the higher the risk. We know one way the virus spreads is through respiratory droplets that are expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\\n\\n‚Äú[This] can also include laughing and singing,‚Äù Patel said. ‚ÄúAll of these actions are essentially expelling much of our lung volume when we do them. In the same context, heavy breathing while exercising would do the same as the aforementioned and, thus, could also cause the spread of a virus. There is no specific study that shows all of this; however, it is extrapolated from numerous studies on virology and respirology.‚Äù\\n\\nWhile Cannuscio said being outdoors in its well-ventilated glory can help reduce the risk of transmission generally, that benefit starts to erode as more people congregate.\\n\\nEven if an outdoor space technically has enough area for each person using it to have a 6-foot buffer around them, people have a habit of encroaching on those boundaries.\\n\\nStaying Home Saves Lives. Could It Also Protect The Economy?\\n\\nLet‚Äôs use the Great Lawn in New York City‚Äôs Central Park as an example. The Great Lawn spans 55 acres, which is a little under 2.4 million square feet. If you drew a circle around yourself with a radius of 3 feet, that circle would have an area of about 28 square feet. With that math, as long as no one‚Äôs circle overlapped, around 80,000 people could safely use Central Park‚Äôs Great Lawn at the same time. But, obviously, people have a habit of not sitting still. Tens of thousands of people aren‚Äôt going to stay 6 feet apart for the entirety of their stay in the park, and navigating around all those people while trying to maintain that buffer would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.\\n\\nBut exercise and fresh air are still recommended. The CDC endorses exercise as a way to manage the stress and anxiety caused by our current social disruption, and some studies have shown that regular exercise can bolster your immune system.\\n\\nNo matter where you are, the key is to avoid other people. This could mean being flexible in your plans (if one trail is busy, find another), going out in the early morning or late evening, or deciding to work out at home more often.\\n\\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always going to be some risk in everything we do,‚Äù said David Nieman, a biology professor who researches immune function at Appalachian State University. ‚ÄúOur goal is to minimize the risk so that we can experience the benefits.‚Äù\\n\\nCORRECTION (April 1, 2020, 5:28 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people who could be on Central Park‚Äôs Great Lawn while remaining at least 6 feet apart.

The question on everybody‚Äôs minds: How bad will this really get? Followed quickly by: Seriously, how long am I going to have to live cooped up like this?\\n\\nWe all want answers. And, given the volume of research and data being collected about the novel coronavirus, it seems like answers ought to exist.\\n\\nThere are certainly numbers out there. Trouble is, they‚Äôre kind of all over the place. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using models that forecast a best-case scenario in which about 200,000 Americans die, according to reporting by The New York Times. Meanwhile, a report from Imperial College London that made headlines for its dire, modeling-based forecasts predicted about 2.2 million U.S. deaths from the coronavirus, if nobody changes their everyday behavior.\\n\\nThat is, to put it mildly, a freaking huge spread ‚Äî the difference between a death toll on par with the number of people who die from injury and violence annually in the U.S. and one that‚Äôs closer to the number of people murdered when the Chinese communists moved to suppress counterrevolutionaries between 1950 and 1953. It is, in other words, the difference between a number we routinely live with, and one that changes a country forever.\\n\\nSo why is that gap so wide? Well, friends, that‚Äôs the nature of modeling this beast. (And one of the reasons why FiveThirtyEight doesn‚Äôt have a model of its own. Thanks for your emails asking for one, though.) Using a mathematical model to predict the future is valuable for experts, even if there are vast gulfs between possible outcomes. But it‚Äôs not always easy to make sense of the results and how they change over time, and that confusion can hurt both your brain and your heart. That‚Äôs why we want to talk about what goes into a model of a pandemic. Hopefully, understanding the uncertainty can help you get the most out of all the numbers flying around.\\n\\nSo, imagine a simple mathematical model to predict coronavirus outcomes. It‚Äôs relatively easy to put together ‚Äî the sort of thing people on our staff do while buzzed on a socially isolated conference call after work. The number of people who will die is a function of how many people could become infected, how the virus spreads and how many people the virus is capable of killing.\\n\\nIn other (more mathematical) words: N( dead ) = N( susceptible population ) * infection rate * fatality rate\\n\\nSee? Easy. But then you start trying to fill in the blanks. That‚Äôs when you discover that there isn‚Äôt a single number to plug into ‚Ä¶ anything. Every variable is dependent on a number of choices and knowledge gaps. And if every individual piece of a model is wobbly, then the model is going to have as much trouble standing on its own as a data journalist who has spent too long on a conference call while socially isolated after work.\\n\\nConsider something as basic as data entry. Different countries and regions collect data in different ways. There‚Äôs no single spreadsheet everyone is filling out that can easily allow us to compare cases and deaths around the world. Even within the United States, doctors say we‚Äôre underreporting the total number of deaths due to COVID-19.\\n\\nThe same inconsistencies apply to who gets tested. Some countries are giving tests to anyone who wants one. Others are ‚Ä¶ not. That affects how much we can know about how many people have actually contracted COVID-19, versus how many people have tested positive.\\n\\nAnd the virus itself is an unpredictable contagion, hurting some groups more than others ‚Äî meaning that local demographics and health care access are going to be big determinants when it comes to the virus‚Äô impact on communities.\\n\\n‚ÄúAs public health people, we‚Äôre often working in a little bit of the dark, trying to make our best estimates with really uncertain information,‚Äù said Dr. Bill Miller, a professor of epidemiology at Ohio State University.\\n\\nSo let‚Äôs explore our super simple model to see why it‚Äôs so hard to make a good model for something this uncertain.\\n\\nTHE FATALITY RATE\\n\\nSome people die from COVID-19. That‚Äôs maybe the last absolute statement we can make here. But ‚Äúsome‚Äù is not a number and you can‚Äôt math with it.\\n\\nThe problem is, calculating the virus‚Äô fatality rate is fuzzy from the very start. It can vary wildly from cohort to cohort. ‚ÄúBecause age is a huge factor, you have to adjust case fatality rates for the demographic makeup of the U.S., and also the rate of comorbidities,‚Äù said Rae Wannier, a biostatistician at the University of California, San Francisco, in an email to FiveThirtyEight. (Comorbidities are other underlying diseases and conditions that can exacerbate the effects of COVID-19.)\\n\\nIn other words, there is no single ‚Äúfatality rate‚Äù ‚Äî there are many. The fatality rate for the United States is going to differ from the fatality rate in a country where, say, diabetes is less prevalent. The same could be said for the rates within the U.S. ‚Äî if the virus spreads in a metro area with many elderly residents, the fatality rate calculated there will be higher than if the epicenter was in a city that skewed younger.\\n\\nBut let‚Äôs stay international for now. Does knowing the fatality rate of COVID-19 in China or Italy tell us what the fatality rate will be in the U.S.? It certainly helps ‚Äî but that just lowers the uncertainty, it doesn‚Äôt make things certain.\\n\\nOf course, we probably don‚Äôt know the actual fatality rate in those places, anyway. That‚Äôs true for a number of reasons, starting with the collection of basic data about coronavirus cases. Numbers aren‚Äôt facts. They‚Äôre the result of a lot of subjective choices that have to be documented transparently and in detail before you can even begin to consider treating the output as fact. How data is gathered ‚Äî and whether it is gathered the same way each time ‚Äî matters.\\n\\nThere‚Äôs also the issue of uncollected or inaccurate data. To determine the fatality rate, you have to divide the number of people who have died from the disease by the number of people infected with the disease. In this case, we don‚Äôt really have a reliable count for the number of people infected ‚Äî so, to put it mathematically, we don‚Äôt know the denominator. (If we‚Äôre being honest, we probably don‚Äôt know exactly what the first number ‚Äî the numerator ‚Äî is, either, but we‚Äôre assuming it‚Äôs closer to correct.)\\n\\nIn an ideal world, we would test everyone in a population for signs of having been infected with the novel coronavirus so we could know for certain how many people have ever had the disease and how many of them died due to it. There are only a couple situations in which that has even gotten close to happening, though. Take the Diamond Princess, one of the cruise ships that got quarantined after a COVID-19 outbreak. Nearly everyone on board was tested (3,063 samples from 3,711 people). The Diamond Princess became a living laboratory with the kind of data documentation conditions we don‚Äôt usually get in the real world. Researchers were able to capture not just how many people had the disease, but also how many were completely asymptomatic ‚Äî and thus, would likely have gone untested, undiagnosed and uncounted had they been on land.\\n\\nThe results of this unusual setup suggest that there are a lot of people walking around with COVID-19 who don‚Äôt know it ‚Äî and, consequently, that the death rates are lower than other data has suggested. In the Diamond Princess population, the fatality rate for people with a diagnosis and symptoms was 2.3 percent, but the fatality rate for all diagnosed cases ‚Äî including those who were asymptomatic ‚Äî was 1.2 percent. In Iceland, a company called deCODE Genetics started offering free screenings to the general, asymptomatic population on March 13. As of March 29, deCODE identified 71 infected people in a sample of 8,694 tests, including asymptomatic infections.\\n\\nMeanwhile, that symptomaticity ratio‚Äî how many people are symptomatic versus asymptomatic‚Äî is a big deal and we‚Äôre mostly just guessing at it right now. The Imperial College London report assumes that two-thirds of cases will be symptomatic enough that the infected person will notice and self-isolate. Data from the Diamond Princess found something more like half of the cases were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. What the symptomaticity ratio turns out to actually be will change fatality rate calculations.\\n\\nThe Diamond Princess data isn‚Äôt perfect ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt test everyone, cruise ship demographics aren‚Äôt representative of the broader population and some sick passengers may still die, which would increase the fatality rate. But you‚Äôre not going to find more reliable stats on land. Iceland‚Äôs data hasn‚Äôt been published with the same level of methodological detail. In the U.S., that kind of widespread testing is only just beginning, and that really matters. If you primarily test sick people, as some states are doing, the fatality rate isn‚Äôt going to reflect anything like the actual fatality rate of the virus. (The denominator problem rears its head again.) And testing in the U.S. has been hampered by additional issues, such as the overall lack of available tests and the fact that some private labs don‚Äôt provide the number of tests that came up negative.\\n\\nThe true fatality rate of the disease is also influenced by our ability to prevent death once someone is grievously ill. And that depends on hospital capacity. Given unlimited access to Intensive Care Unit beds and ventilators, many people with even severe symptoms could survive the infection. But these resources are relatively scarce, and if demand exceeds supply ‚Äî as it already has in some parts of the country ‚Äî people who would have survived with a ventilator will likely die. This can have knock-on effects. People seeking treatment for unrelated accidents or emergencies could also suffer from the lack of hospital resources, and their potentially preventable deaths ‚Äî even from causes unrelated to COVID-19 ‚Äî will add to the overall death toll ‚Äî even if those don‚Äôt get counted as COVID-19 deaths.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhether we end up seeing supply and personnel shortages will greatly impact fatality, and it is not yet clear the degree to which there is elasticity in our medical system,‚Äù Wannier said.\\n\\nTHEN THERE‚ÄôS THE INFECTION RATE\\n\\nPretty much everything we‚Äôve already said about the fatality rate applies to the infection rate as well: The estimates are all going to be affected by data collection, sampling and symptomaticity ratios. But to know the infection rate, you also have to figure out how often the virus moves from one person to another. (You‚Äôve probably heard the term basic reproduction number, or R0, thrown around, which is the average number of new infections traced back to each infected person in a population where everyone is susceptible to the disease.)\\n\\nHere‚Äôs the thing: Transmission is likely to be extremely variable, dependent on all kinds of social behaviors, local environmental details and political decisions. It‚Äôs not going to be the same from one country to another. It‚Äôs probably not going to be the same from one state to another. It‚Äôs going to change over time depending on what actions we take to combat the virus. Malaria, for example, has a higher basic reproduction number in places where there‚Äôs a lot of standing water.\\n\\nBecause of this, modeling potential outcomes for coronavirus means trying out a lot of different transmission scenarios. Even those scenarios aren‚Äôt exact, though; they‚Äôre more like a range of estimates. There are several variables that go into those estimates ‚Äî and each of those is, itself, variable. (Seriously, you guys, this is turtles all the way down.)\\n\\nThe first variable is the rate of contact ‚Äî basically how many people an infected person interacts with in a given period of time. This is the only thing that people can control and it‚Äôs why everyone is spending all this time indoors, talking about social distancing. Average rate of contact isn‚Äôt uniform ‚Äî it differs from person to person, depending on factors like their living situation and job, and it changes based on public health interventions and location. ‚ÄúImagine the difference in contact rate between the Appalachian part of Ohio and, you know, downtown Cleveland or Columbus,‚Äù Miller said.\\n\\nThen comes the rate of transmission per contact. This is just a way of thinking about how many of the people an infected person meets will become infected themselves. It, too, is a moving target. Viruses don‚Äôt spread in an orderly, two-new-cases-per-person fashion. Instead, cases tend to happen in uneven rushes, like a hoard of suburbanites descending on a grocery store‚Äôs toilet paper aisle. Sam Scarpino, a professor at Northeastern University who models infectious diseases, described these as ‚Äúsuperspreader events‚Äù ‚Äî situations where some factor, usually something to do with the location rather than the people themselves, boosts the number of cases in a sudden burst. Think about that Biogen conference that was, at one point, responsible for 77 of the 95 cases then diagnosed in Massachusetts. Or the woman who single-handedly broke South Korea‚Äôs previously effective containment strategy.\\n\\nAnd remember that symptomaticity ratio? Some assume that asymptomatic carriers are less infectious than people who are showing symptoms, so that ratio plays into the transmission rate as well.\\n\\nVirus biology also matters when you‚Äôre trying to calculate transmissions per contact. This includes stuff like how long the virus can survive on a surface (and which surfaces it‚Äôs landing on) and how far it can be flung through the air. With the novel coronavirus, there are currently competing estimates for both those factors. And then there‚Äôs differences in human bodies and behavior. Smokers, for instance, might be at a greater risk of infection and complications from the virus. And while a lot of that has to do with the impact of smoking on the lungs and what the virus does once it‚Äôs in the body, some of it is also likely tied up in the fact that current smokers are putting their hands near their mouths more often than the average person, increasing transmission risk.\\n\\nFinally, there‚Äôs the duration of infectiousness ‚Äî how long a person can spread the virus to other people, and when during the disease‚Äôs progression are they infectious? This varies with virus biology and individual immune systems, said Mark Weir, a director of Ohio State University‚Äôs ecology, epidemiology and population health program.\\n\\nAll of these parameters are used to estimate R0, that basic reproduction number of the virus.\\n\\nWhile the basic reproduction number assumes the entire population is susceptible, there‚Äôs also an effective reproduction number, which depends on how much of the population is susceptible. One of the reasons that so much of the population is seen as likely to be susceptible is that the novel coronavirus is just that ‚Äî novel. Nobody has had it before.\\n\\nA good model needs to also think about questions of reinfection: if people who have had the virus and recovered are immune to getting it again, the susceptible population shrinks. But so far, we don‚Äôt know much about post-infection immunity with this virus.\\n\\nAnd that doesn‚Äôt even get into how susceptibility changes if something like a vaccine is discovered. But we‚Äôve gone on long enough.\\n\\nMIX IT ALL UP IN A MODEL\\n\\nTo make a model, then, you have to assemble all those variables (and others our editor wouldn‚Äôt let us mention), account for their uncertainty, how correlated they are to each other and all sorts of other stuff. It can get messy.\\n\\nAnd all of these factors can be affected by all the interventions we‚Äôve tried to reduce the virus‚Äô spread ‚Äî social distancing, hand-washing, school closing, reducing elective surgeries, and the like. This is the big unknown that can drastically change the shape of the outbreak ‚Äî and yet it also differs by country, state and even city.\\n\\nThink of it like making a pie. If you have a normal recipe, you can do it pretty easily and expect a predictable result that makes sense. But if the recipe contains instructions like ‚Äúadd three to 15 chopped apples, or steaks, or brussels sprouts, depending on what you have on hand‚Äù ‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs going to affect how tasty this pie is, isn‚Äôt it? You can make assumptions about the correct ingredients and their quantity. But those are assumptions ‚Äî not absolute facts. And if you make too many assumptions in your pie-baking process, you might very well end up with something entirely different than what you were meant to be making. And you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily know you got it wrong.\\n\\nOver the next few months, you are going to see many different predictions about COVID-19 outcomes. They won‚Äôt all agree. But just because they‚Äôre based on assumptions doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre worthless.\\n\\n‚ÄúAll models are wrong, it‚Äôs striving to make them less wrong and useful in the moment,‚Äù Weir said.\\n\\nWe‚Äôre hungry, so somebody has to do some baking. But be sure to ask what ingredients went into that pie and in what quantities.\\n\\nStaying Home Saves Lives.

He should know ‚Äî over the past 20 years, he has published multiple research papers investigating the minutia of hand-washing. (Work that is extremely relevant to the public interest all of a sudden.) And those decades of work have taught him that there are just too many things living on our hands to wash all of them off. In fact, he says, killing all the microbes on your hands has never even been the point of hand-washing. The point is to get as big a reduction in microbes as possible, while balancing that effort with the demands of real life.\\n\\nTechnically, Schaffner is a professor of food science at Rutgers University, where he studies food safety and the microbiology of the stuff we eat. But for our purposes, he‚Äôs a hand-washing expert. And his expertise can help shed some light on a lot of simplified tips we‚Äôve been hearing since the COVID-19 pandemic began. ‚ÄúHand-washing isn‚Äôt magic. It doesn‚Äôt magically sterilize your hands,‚Äù Schaffner told me. And that‚Äôs an important thing to understand, because it helps explain one of the numerical oddities of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says to wash your hands for 20 seconds. The World Health Organization says hand-washing should take 40 to 60 seconds. Who is right? And why? Oh, that‚Äôs easy, Schaffner said. The answer is neither. And both. It‚Äôs complicated.\\n\\nBy necessity, food safety researchers have to think in orders of magnitude. Instead of aiming to completely obliterate a population of microbes, they‚Äôre trying to achieve a relative decrease as measured in orders of 10. This is called a logarithmic reduction. A 1-log reduction would be a 10-fold decrease ‚Äî so, 90 percent fewer germs. A 2-log reduction is a 100-fold decrease ‚Äî so 99 percent fewer germs ‚Äî and 3-log is 1,000 times less, or 99.9 percent fewer. You get the picture.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhich sounds good, right, except that in microbiology we may be dealing with millions of organisms,‚Äù Schaffner said. A 2-log reduction on 1 million microorganisms still leaves 10,000 organisms left. ‚ÄúAnd in some cases with these organisms, it may only take a single organism to make you sick.‚Äù\\n\\nMeasurements of the log reductions are how we know that washing with soap is more effective at removing microorganisms than simply washing with water. In pre-coronavirus studies, scientists found that washing with antimicrobial soap ‚Äî something containing the antibacterial chemical triclosan, say ‚Äî was more effective than washing with plain old soap. Alcohol-based hand rub was more effective than either of those.\\n\\nIn fact, it turns out that what you‚Äôre washing with has a much bigger statistical effect than how long you‚Äôre washing.\\n\\nThat‚Äôs something Schaffner found out years ago when his team reviewed the literature on hand-washing techniques ‚Äî oh, yeah, this is a whole field, people ‚Äî to determine which findings held consistent across research by different groups and which were flukes in the data from one or two studies. They ended up analyzing 25 publications, which included more than 300 individual experiments.\\n\\n‚ÄúIn this paper, we looked at wash times of 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI have some at 90 seconds and some at 120 and even one paper that studied 180 seconds. And if you look at the trend line, it‚Äôs not like the longer you wash the better it gets.‚Äù\\n\\nIn fact, the log reductions vary widely between trials that use the same time length. There are 30-second hand-washing trials that don‚Äôt reduce the microbial load at all ‚Ä¶ and ones with a reduction greater than 4-log. The best of the 120-second trials doesn‚Äôt break 3-log. The 180-second trial barely gets better than a 1-log reduction. The difference probably has to do with other variables like specific soap formulation, the type and amount of microorganisms, and individual technique.\\n\\nThis uncertainty is a big part of why there‚Äôs not consistency between expert recommendations for how long you should be washing your hands now, during this coronavirus epidemic. Even the CDC has acknowledged that this sort of thing is an issue: ‚ÄúThe optimal length of time for hand-washing is also likely to depend on many factors, including the type and amount of soil on the hands and the setting of the person washing hands,‚Äù it wrote on a non-COVID-19 webpage.\\n\\nNeither the CDC nor the WHO returned requests for comment. (We hear they‚Äôre a little busy.) But Schaffner‚Äôs best guess is that the firm-sounding time recommendations are determined less by evidence and more by evidence-based estimating ‚Äî picking times that aren‚Äôt so short that the job doesn‚Äôt get done and aren‚Äôt so long that people give up.\\n\\nAnd that‚Äôs true about a lot of risk management, Schaffner told me. Another good example is the temperature you wash at. Namely, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Again, the issue is about the soap and about how you‚Äôre rubbing your hands around. That will work in cold water as well as warm. But the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs food code for restaurant safety still expects hand-washing sinks to be able to deliver very hot water. Science can give you a range of answers under different scenarios and likelihoods of accuracy. ‚ÄúBut at the end of the day, some person somewhere has to write down a number,‚Äù Schaffner said.\\n\\nThat‚Äôs not to say that hand-washing isn‚Äôt important. It is. It‚Äôs just not something you can expect to be an exact science, with perfect results that are perfectly replicable. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big believer in hand-washing,‚Äù Schaffner told me. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs good. We should have been doing it before the pandemic. We should keep doing it after. And, heck, let‚Äôs do it during the pandemic, too.‚Äù\\n\\nStaying Home Saves Lives.

President Trump has enthusiastically touted this idea ‚Äî suggesting in particular the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, two antimalarial drugs.\\n\\nBut safe and effective treatment of COVID-19 isn‚Äôt as simple as handing out medication currently available. Doctors can prescribe drugs to treat illnesses other than the ones they were approved for, and many may already be doing that to fight this disease. But experts say that‚Äôs a risky and unreliable way to combat the pandemic, and it may cause more harm than good.\\n\\nWhy The U.S. Can‚Äôt Process Coronavirus Tests As Fast As South Korea\\n\\n‚ÄúPeople can die from these drugs, and we would never know they died from the drugs because we didn‚Äôt have controls,‚Äù said Dr. Andre Kalil, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\\n\\nEvery medication has potential side effects, and doctors have to weigh the risks and benefits whenever they prescribe one. This is true even for something as simple as aspirin, which is often used to prevent heart attacks and strokes but also comes with side effects like an increased risk of bleeding.\\n\\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt put healthy 30-year-olds on aspirin,‚Äù said Dr. Caleb Alexander, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not because aspirin won‚Äôt help prevent a heart attack ‚Äî it will. It‚Äôs because a healthy 30-year-old has such an unlikely risk of having a heart attack that the possibility of bleeding from aspirin outweighs the benefit.‚Äù\\n\\nThough medications like chloroquine and the antiviral drug remdesivir are being considered to fight COVID-19, doctors can‚Äôt do a proper risk-benefit analysis because they don‚Äôt yet know whether these drugs are actually effective in treating the infection. Experts suspect they might be because they have antiviral or anti-inflammation properties or because in vitro tests or very preliminary trials have shown positive results, but until researchers conduct full trials, we simply don‚Äôt know. Giving out drugs in the hopes that they might work is not only unscientific but also dangerous.\\n\\n‚ÄúA common interpretation of off-label use and compassionate use of drugs is that if the patient died, they died from the disease, but if the patient survived, they survived because of the given drug,‚Äù Kalil wrote in a column published March 24 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. ‚ÄúThis is not true.‚Äù\\n\\nWe do know that the drugs being considered come with their own risks. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for example, can cause a potentially life-threatening type of heart arrhythmia known as QT prolongation. If those drugs end up being ineffective at treating COVID-19, using them could put a patient‚Äôs life at risk for nothing.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhat happens if you combine those two [drugs]? We actually don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Almut Winterstein, a pharmacoepidemiologist at the University of Florida. ‚ÄúYou could get severe arrhythmia. It could kill people. This is where clinical trials become very important.‚Äù\\n\\nWith the 2014-2016 Ebola virus outbreak, many doctors took the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just try it‚Äù approach, without control trials, Kalil said. Because of this, we still don‚Äôt know whether some of those treatments worked or were actually hastening death instead of healing patients.\\n\\n‚ÄúI could list for hours the number of drugs and medications that were given to patients with Ebola, and I can tell you that we found absolutely nothing,‚Äù Kalil said. ‚ÄúPeople definitely were harmed by these drugs, and we‚Äôre never going to know because nothing was given with controls.‚Äù\\n\\nThe gold standard for researching new treatments is conducting randomized controlled trials, in which one group is randomly assigned to take the drug being tested and the other group gets a placebo. If people in the group taking the drug recover more quickly than those taking the placebo, it‚Äôs a good indicator that the drug works.\\n\\nNo drugs currently on the market have previously gone through control trials to treat COVID-19 specifically. Because of this, we can‚Äôt be certain how effective or safe they would be. And even when a treatment seems promising, it may not end up being effective: Lopinavir-ritonavir, a combination of anti-HIV drugs, was considered a possible treatment for COVID-19, but a clinical study published March 18 showed the pair had no substantial benefit on patients.\\n\\nOther clinical trials for existing medications, such as remdesivir, have already begun, including one sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and led by Kalil. It will take weeks, and possibly months, for the trials to be completed, and there‚Äôs a chance that none of the drugs being investigated will effectively treat COVID-19. But it‚Äôs the only hope we have of figuring out whether these drugs actually work and are safe to use.\\n\\n‚ÄúI understand we are all anxious to get everything as fast as possible,‚Äù Kalil said. ‚ÄúBut the moment you compromise quality, the moment you don‚Äôt do the science correctly, you may end up hurting more people.‚Äù', 'author': ['Kaleigh Rogers']}, {'link': 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-coronavirus-isnt-just-a-blue-state-problem/', 'published': '2020-03-27T17:33:18', 'title': 'The Coronavirus Isn‚Äôt Just A Blue State Problem', 'text': 'Washington state was the initial epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States.

Weighted by state populations, the difference is slightly larger: 141 percent in states Trump won and 88 percent in states Clinton won.\\n\\nFor now, states Clinton won do have considerably more total reported cases. As of Thursday, Clinton states had 4.29 positive tests per 10,000 people, as compared to 1.13 per 10,000 people in Trump states. A lot of that difference is attributable to New York; without New York, Clinton states have 1.89 cases per 10,000 people.\\n\\nBut the nature of exponential growth is such that these differences could evaporate in a hurry. If reported cases in Trump states continued to increase at 119 percent every three days (about 30 percent per day) while reported cases in Clinton states increased by 88 percent every three days (about 23 percent per day), then the per capita case count in Trump states would surpass that in Clinton states within about 30 days, or by late April.\\n\\nHopefully, the rate of increase will slow in both types of states as we begin to see further effects of social distancing measures in the data. However, these measures were generally enacted earlier and have been more forceful in blue states. That means the rate at which new cases are being diagnosed could slow down faster in blue states than in red states, meaning that red states would catch up earlier.\\n\\nBlue states have also conducted more testing than red states. In states with reliable estimates of the number of positive and negative tests as of Thursday night, Clinton states had conducted 21.8 tests per 10,000 people as compared to 12.5 tests per 10,000 people in Trump states.\\n\\nBlue states have done more COVID-19 testing Tests completed per capita as of March 26, in states with reliable reporting on the number of negative tests State Tests completed per 10k people* 2016 winner New York 62.8 Clinton Louisiana 38.8 Trump New Mexico 37.2 Clinton Massachusetts 34.0 Clinton Vermont 32.2 Clinton Maine 26.4 Clinton District of Columbia 26.3 Clinton Alaska 25.4 Trump Utah 24.0 Trump New Jersey 23.1 Clinton New Hampshire 23.1 Clinton Minnesota 23.0 Clinton South Dakota 22.8 Trump Tennessee 21.8 Trump Wisconsin 21.1 Trump Montana 20.6 Trump Connecticut 18.6 Clinton Oregon 17.3 Clinton Nevada 16.6 Clinton Ohio 14.8 Trump Rhode Island 14.2 Clinton Pennsylvania 14.2 Trump Illinois 13.1 Clinton Idaho 12.2 Trump Florida 12.2 Trump Kansas 10.4 Trump Michigan 9.4 Trump Nebraska 8.6 Trump Georgia 8.4 Trump Alabama 8.4 Trump Texas 7.4 Trump Kentucky 7.4 Trump Virginia 7.3 Clinton Arkansas 6.1 Trump West Virginia 6.0 Trump California 5.2 Clinton Oklahoma 3.0 Trump * Excluding tests that are listed as pending. Sources: The COVID Tracking Project, U.S. Census\\n\\nThat means the true gap in the number of cases may not be as large as the roughly fourfold difference in reported cases between blue states and red states right now. States such as Louisiana have discovered they have far more cases than they originally realized as they‚Äôve ramped up testing over the past week, and other red states (and blue states) could follow.\\n\\nCOVID-19 has also led to a slightly higher case fatality rate (the number of deaths as a share of the number of known cases) in red states so far. As of Thursday evening, the death rate per case was 1.7 percent in Trump states as compared to 1.3 percent in Clinton states. This could reflect a variety of factors, including potential underreporting of cases in Trump states, the age and health of the populations in each set of states, or the efficacy of responses by local health care systems.\\n\\nHowever, the higher fatality rate it is a somewhat troubling sign for red states given that many of them are generally at an earlier point in their epidemic curves, meaning that many people who have acquired COVID-19 in those states have done so recently and have not yet developed the most serious symptoms that could lead to long-term hospitalization or death.', 'author': ['Nate Silver']}, {'link': 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-should-the-government-spend-to-save-a-life/', 'published': '2020-03-27T11:00:40', 'title': 'What Should The Government Spend To Save A Life?', 'text': 'The staggering economic toll of the new coronavirus is becoming abundantly, unavoidably clear. On Thursday, a Department of Labor report showed that a record-shattering 3.3 million people applied for initial unemployment claims last week. And with entire industries shuttered for the foreseeable future, economic output will almost certainly shrink dramatically.\\n\\nAs economic forecasts grow darker, talk of tradeoffs is getting louder: Is protecting Americans from COVID-19 really worth all this disruption and economic pain?\\n\\nOn March 22, before President Trump floated the idea of reopening the economy by Easter, against the recommendations of his own public health experts, he tweeted, ‚ÄúWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.‚Äù Other politicians, meanwhile, rejected the idea that economic costs should be a factor at all. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo dismissed Trump‚Äôs push to get the economy moving again, saying, ‚ÄúNo American is going to say, ‚Äòaccelerate the economy at the cost of human life.‚Äô Because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.‚Äù\\n\\nCuomo‚Äôs sentiment might be a nice bit of political rhetoric, but it‚Äôs not really true. Economists might not be able to say how much an individual person‚Äôs existence is worth, but they have figured out a way to calculate how much the average person is willing to pay to reduce the risk of death ‚Äî which allows them to put a price tag on the collective value of saving one life. That figure, which currently hovers somewhere around $9 or $10 million, is known as the ‚Äúvalue of statistical life,‚Äù and it‚Äôs the basis for all kinds of high-stakes decisions that involve tradeoffs between public safety and economic cost ‚Äî from food and automobile regulations to our responses to climate change.\\n\\nAs cold-blooded as it might seem, several economists told me that, at least in theory, a pandemic is exactly the kind of situation this metric is designed to help with. ‚ÄúEssentially, we‚Äôre trying to figure out what our society is willing to pay to reduce the risk of mortality,‚Äù said W. Kip Viscusi, an economist at Vanderbilt University and one of the leading experts on these calculations. ‚ÄúIn that sense, a pandemic isn‚Äôt so different from a terrorist attack or a pollutant that‚Äôs threatening to kill large numbers of people ‚Äî it‚Äôs just happening very quickly and on a very large scale.‚Äù\\n\\nThe idea that a life could have a monetary value isn‚Äôt necessarily easy to swallow from an ethical perspective. Economists and government regulators have to balance the risk of death against all kinds of other factors, though, and the concept of the VSL was developed several decades ago because economists didn‚Äôt like the idea of assigning that value through other, more intuitive means, like our contributions to the economy as workers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fairly simple to value someone‚Äôs life based on how much money they make,‚Äù said Spencer Banzhaf, an economist at Georgia State University who has written about the history of the VSL. ‚ÄúBut in addition to being baldly crude, that‚Äôs just not reflective of the way we think about people. We don‚Äôt think a retired person is worth nothing.‚Äù\\n\\nThe VSL, instead of trying to sum up the value of a life, approaches the question from the other direction ‚Äî how much are we willing to spend to reduce the odds of dying?\\n\\nEconomists draw the numbers from multiple sources, including surveys and assumptions about our own choices, like how much additional money people earn for especially dangerous jobs, or how much a premium they‚Äôll pay for a safer car. The estimates do vary, but they fall in the same basic range ‚Äî the EPA‚Äôs valuation falls around $9.4 million, while Viscusi‚Äôs latest calculation is $10 million. To put it another way, Viscusi‚Äôs estimate means that if a group of 10,000 people is facing a 1-in-10,000 risk of death, they‚Äôre willing to pay $1,000 per person to reduce the odds that any given member of the community will die.\\n\\nThese numbers show why spending trillions of dollars to combat a threat like the coronavirus pandemic can be a good investment, despite the high cost. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say one of our worst-case scenarios comes to pass, and 2 million people die,‚Äù said James Hammitt, an economist at Harvard‚Äôs T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. ‚ÄúMultiply that by $9 million or $10 million and we‚Äôre talking about up to $20 trillion as the value of preventing those deaths. That suggests it‚Äôs worth expending a fair amount of our resources to mitigate this.‚Äù\\n\\nBut back-of-the-envelope calculations can obscure some of the knottier questions that plague economists who have studied this issue for decades. The VSL varies by country, because the wealth of the average person in a rich country like the United States is much higher than that of a person in a poorer country like India, which means Americans can ‚Äúpay‚Äù more to avoid risk. That outcome is liable to make most people uncomfortable, and weighing the value of other types of lives ‚Äî for example, the young versus the old ‚Äî is tricky, too.\\n\\nFor example, even though the coronavirus appears to result in a much higher mortality rate for older people ‚Äî prompting some politicians to propose that they should consider sacrificing themselves to save the economy ‚Äî trying to put a lower price tag on their lives hasn‚Äôt worked well in the past. Joseph Aldy, a public policy professor at Harvard‚Äôs Kennedy School of Government, said that under President George W. Bush, the EPA tried to put a lower value on the life of an older person in calculating the benefits of air quality regulations. In their analysis, the life of a person over the age of 70 was worth 37 percent less than the life of a younger person.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt was a political disaster,‚Äù Aldy said. The policy was christened the ‚Äúsenior death discount‚Äù and in response, AARP ran ads featuring a picture of an elderly woman with a ‚Äú37 percent OFF!‚Äù tag hanging from her glasses. The EPA backed off and never implemented the proposed changes.\\n\\nOutside the glare of the political spotlight, though, that experience hasn‚Äôt stopped economists from exploring whether age-based valuations are right in some circumstances. There‚Äôs evidence, Aldy said, that people‚Äôs willingness to pay to reduce the risk of mortality starts to decrease after age 50. But those kinds of calculations, he added, are sometimes disconnected from the moral valuations we make collectively. ‚ÄúWe spend the vast majority of our health care dollars on people over the age of 65, and yet one might say the age-adjusted value of statistical life for that population is lower,‚Äù Aldy said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a kind of social compact ‚Äî we recognize your contributions to our society and will provide the resources to keep you healthy as you age. So how far can this economic analysis really go when we‚Äôve made that decision as a society?‚Äù\\n\\nAnd even accounting for age might not provide a compelling argument against the measures currently being taken in response to the pandemic. Two economists used age-adjusted VSL in a recent analysis of the economic cost of social distancing ‚Äî and they still found that the public health response to coronavirus had ‚Äúsubstantial economic benefits.‚Äù\\n\\nThe sheer uncertainty of the coronavirus crisis is another problem ‚Äî both in terms of the potential death toll and economic impact. Estimates of how many people might die in the U.S. are all over the place ‚Äî some as low as 200,000, others as high as 2 million. And Banzhaf said that just as age-based calculations have their limitations, the scope of the economic costs has to go beyond earnings or GDP. ‚ÄúDepending on how long this shutdown goes on, we‚Äôre talking about a huge hit to the common good and our way of life,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf symphonies, hotels, art galleries, restaurants close and can‚Äôt come back ‚Äî that‚Äôs a loss that goes way beyond earnings dollars. I don‚Äôt know how you begin to quantify it.‚Äù\\n\\nIf anything, though, the uncertainty and fear of the coronavirus pandemic could drive the value of statistical life even higher. Studies have shown, Hammitt said, that because people are more afraid of flying on airplanes than driving in cars, they are willing to shell out for airplane safety measures. ‚ÄúWe see the same thing with terrorism risk,‚Äù Hammitt said. ‚ÄúWhen a kind of death is more dreaded or ambiguous, people are willing to pay more to avoid dying that way.‚Äù\\n\\nBut Aldy told me that cost-benefit analyses would have been most helpful at earlier stages of the crisis, when the government had the opportunity to invest in testing and surveillance. At this point, he told me, he wasn‚Äôt sure why a cost-benefit analysis was needed to drive home the cost of a huge loss of life ‚Äî particularly since he, like many other economists and public health experts, thinks that containing the virus is the best way to ensure the economy rebounds quickly.\\n\\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say we‚Äôre talking about 1 million deaths or 2 million deaths,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen you think about the economic damage and the damage to families and communities all over the country, I don‚Äôt think you need an egghead like me to try to put a price on that. It‚Äôs catastrophic.‚Äù\\n\\nCORRECTION (March 27, 2020, 12:35 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the odds required for 10,000 people being willing to pay $1,000 per person to reduce the odds that any given member of the community will die.

The survey asks each expert questions about the trajectory of the COVID-19 virus and they respond with three different scenarios: the most likely, the best case and the worst case. The responses are combined to produce a probabilistic consensus forecast, which can answer questions such as how many cases and deaths we should expect as well as how likely each scenario is.\\n\\nThe latest survey, taken on March 23 and 24, shows that experts have not become more certain or increasingly optimistic over the last week. According to the most recent survey, experts think 9 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the U.S. were known at the time of the survey. As a group, they think hospitalizations won‚Äôt peak for several more weeks or months, and they expect around 246,000 deaths related to COVID-19 in 2020.\\n\\n‚ÄúThe situation this week is no more clear due to the diversity of responses across states, and uncertainty about the impact of those responses,‚Äù said Justin Lessler, one of the respondents and an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nBut, he added, if we ‚Äúadhere to guidance around social distancing, take all symptoms seriously, and self-isolate at the first sign of potential infection,‚Äù it‚Äôs possible the outcome will fall closer to the best-case scenario.\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what else the researchers had to say this week:\\n\\nWhat is the smallest, most likely and largest number of total cases that The COVID Tracking Project will report on March 29?\\n\\nThere is a huge amount of variation and uncertainty in the experts‚Äô projection for the number of cases that will be reported this Sunday. The number depends not only on how quickly the virus spreads, but also on how much our testing capacity increases.\\n\\nThe consensus forecast suggests there will be around 117,000 cases reported this Sunday, with a 90 percent chance of having between 55,000 and 246,000.\\n\\nThis is up quite a bit from last week, when the consensus forecast said there would only be around 19,000 cases on March 29, though there was a change in what experts are being asked to forecast. In past surveys, the experts have been asked to forecast numbers published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tend to be lower than those from other sources. (Also, the CDC data updates only on weekdays, so Sunday‚Äôs numbers are the same as Friday‚Äôs.) This week, the survey asks experts to forecast numbers published by The COVID Tracking Project, which aggregates data collected from state or other local public health authorities.\\n\\nHow many people will die in the U.S. due to COVID-19 this year?\\n\\nExperts also projected a wide range of outcomes when it comes to the number of deaths that will be attributed to COVID-19 in 2020.\\n\\n‚ÄúThe uncertainty in the number of deaths is mainly due to two things,‚Äù said Andrew Lover, a survey respondent and epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. ‚Äú1) we‚Äôre not sure how interventions will be implemented ‚Äî there are various types of stay-at-home, quarantine, lockdown interventions ‚Äî and 2) if there‚Äôs a large influx into hospitals and health care workers start to get infected and can not work, things may spiral quickly.‚Äù\\n\\nLessler said that the uncertainty stems from the success of interventions, as well as how far the virus spread before it was noticed and states went on lockdown.\\n\\nThe expert consensus is that COVID-19 will cause 246,000 deaths in 2020, higher than last week‚Äôs estimate of 200,000 deaths. The consensus estimate ranges, though, between 36,000 and 1.1 million. That‚Äôs quite a span, with major implications for American society tucked into that uncertainty.\\n\\nHow do we stay at the low end of the range? ‚ÄúWe need to protect health care system capacity by following stay-at-home and social isolation guidance ‚Äî that‚Äôs really all we have at this very moment,‚Äù Lover said.\\n\\nHow many total COVID-19 infections were actually in the U.S. on March 23?\\n\\nWhen the survey was conducted on March 23, The COVID Tracking Project listed about 33,000 COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Every expert surveyed thought this number understated the actual number of infections in the U.S., with one suggesting there may have already been more than 6 million infections at that time.\\n\\nThe expert consensus is that the real number of infections was somewhere between 83,000 and 1.8 million, with 362,000 being the most likely number.\\n\\nIn other words, they thought that only 9 percent of all infections had been reported, down a bit from 12 percent last week.\\n\\nOf the next six months, which month will see the most COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the U.S.?\\n\\nHospitalizations in some areas of the country are rising sharply, but experts think the peak is still likely weeks or months away. When looking at the next six months, experts said hospitalizations are most likely to peak in May, according to the survey. There‚Äôs a 69 percent chance the peak will fall somewhere between May and August, experts think.\\n\\nHow many states and territories will report more than 100 cases by March 29?\\n\\nAs of Monday, there were 32 states and territories reporting at least 100 cases of COVID-19. By Sunday, the experts think the virus will have spread rapidly, and between 37 and 50 states and territories will have at least 100 cases, with 45 being the experts‚Äô consensus forecast.\\n\\nAccording to this week‚Äôs expert survey, the most likely outlook is a bit more dire than it was last week. But there‚Äôs still a wide range of trajectories, and with the proper responses, we can stay closer to the best-case end of that range.\\n\\nCLARIFICATION (March 25, 2020, 5:30 p.m.): This article has been updated to more precisely reflect the language that survey administrators used in their questions to experts.

At the very least, learning a little more about the tests for COVID-19 will help you understand why it‚Äôs so hard to get one when you need it.\\n\\nWhat happens when you get a COVID-19 test?\\n\\nFirst, a medical professional puts a swab ‚Äî an extra long, one-headed Q-tip ‚Äî way, way, way up your nose. That captures viral particles, along with a bunch of other stuff that Dr. Davey Smith, a research virologist at the University of California, San Diego, referred to as ‚Äúbiological gunk,‚Äù like mucus and random cells. The next step, Smith said, is isolating the viral RNA ‚Äî the genetic material that the virus uses to replicate itself. The RNA in a virus like the one that causes COVID-19 is similar to DNA, but instead of the twisted ladder of a double helix, it‚Äôs half that because it‚Äôs split down the middle. Some viruses carry their genetic code as DNA, but RNA viruses mutate a lot faster. That feature helps them jump species and evade both natural and medical efforts to kill them. Influenza, for instance, mutates so quickly that we need a new vaccine for it every year.\\n\\nJust like DNA can identify a person, RNA can identify the virus that causes COVID-19. Isolating it requires a series of steps ‚Äî adding different chemicals and repeatedly spinning the sample in a centrifuge ‚Äî that aim to separate the sample into layers like a fancy cocktail shot, with the layer containing the RNA floating on the top. Then the RNA has to be further purified. There‚Äôs more than one way to separate out RNA, and companies sell kits that include the chemicals you need to make it work (called reagents, because they‚Äôre used to induce a chemical reaction).\\n\\nWhy The U.S. Can‚Äôt Process Coronavirus Tests As Fast As South Korea\\n\\nFrom there, the RNA is mixed with short segments of DNA called primers. The primers and RNA get combined with loose building blocks of DNA, enzymes that work like genetic construction crews, and more reagents. Mix it all up, and your RNA turns into DNA.\\n\\nFinally, the new DNA needs to be replicated until you have enough of it to actually study. That‚Äôs another chemistry kit ‚Äî more primers, building blocks and reagents ‚Äî doing what basically amounts to biological copy-paste, over and over. This is called a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the primers used here are especially important. These replication primers are basically fragments of the virus you‚Äôre looking for, Smith said, that will bind to the genetic material of that specific virus and nothing else If there‚Äôs no COVID-19 in the sample, then COVID-19 primers won‚Äôt replicate any DNA.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe put in some special dyes so when it builds the right DNA we‚Äôre looking for, we can see the color light up on special machines,‚Äù Smith said. If you had COVID-19, your sample will now show up with freshly built, brightly colored DNA to prove it.\\n\\nWow, that‚Äôs a lot. Is that why people can‚Äôt get their COVID-19 test results for several days?\\n\\nWell, no. This process is not particularly special or time-consuming and involves techniques used all the time in genetic research. PCR, in particular, is so crucial to the entire field that the guy who invented it won a Nobel Prize back in 1993. We use this same technique to test for all kinds of other viruses, from influenza to Zika, said Dr. Mary Jo Trepka, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Florida International University.\\n\\nPCR doesn‚Äôt actually take that long to do ‚Äî you can get results from an influenza PCR test in 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the chemistry set-style kits are something you can order from a website, and other needed machines can be as cheap as a used sedan. Any lab that works regularly with DNA has the ability, in theory, to do this testing.\\n\\nIn other words, the bottleneck slowing down test results is not a technical one. It‚Äôs about logistics and supplies, Smith said. In the earliest days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was conducting all the COVID-19 testing in-house so they could monitor quality control, and they‚Äôve been slow to authorize new labs to use their test kits. As more labs came online, though, they began running low on everything from the swabs they stick up people‚Äôs noses to the reagents that power the PCR‚Äôs chemical reactions to the human lab techs who actually do the tests, Smith and Trepka told me. It‚Äôs like a traffic jam.\\n\\nCompare that to South Korea, where people can get their results in about a day. There, the government had been stockpiling the necessary chemicals for years after COVID-19‚Äôs cousin MERS briefly hit that country in 2015. That helped the country move quickly to approve and decentralize testing as soon as COVID-19 arrived.\\n\\nSo, wait. Is there no difference between South Korea‚Äôs test and ours, then?\\n\\nThere is a difference, but that doesn‚Äôt have much to do with why ours takes so much longer, Smith said. The differences are really just about which primers are being used. Researchers choose which chunks of a virus‚Äôs genetic code to use as a primer with an eye to making sure those primers are a) unique to the specific virus they‚Äôre looking for and b) likely to get preserved in any random bit of viral RNA scraped off the back of somebody‚Äôs nasal cavity. If the primer isn‚Äôt unique enough, you can get false positives. If the sequence your primer is looking for doesn‚Äôt make it from nose to test tube, then you‚Äôll get false negatives.\\n\\nThere‚Äôs not really anything wrong with the primers the CDC test uses, Smith told me. Even when the CDC test was malfunctioning, that was about an inconsistent reagent, not the unique primers. South Korea is faster than us because it can conduct the tests in more places, and could right from the start. Plus, it has more supplies to do the tests with.\\n\\nIs there no other way to test for COVID-19?\\n\\nFor right now, nope. That‚Äôs changing fast, though there are trade-offs. PCR is a great way to test for viruses because it‚Äôs both specific (unlikely to produce false positives) and sensitive (unlikely to produce false negatives), Trepka said. There are other tools that doctors use to test for more familiar viruses. For instance, if you think you have the flu, there‚Äôs a test you can take right in your doctor‚Äôs office that looks for antigens ‚Äî the substances on a virus that stimulate your immune system into action. It produces results in as little as 10 minutes, but it‚Äôs not very sensitive and might tell you that you have the flu even if you don‚Äôt. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre helpful in clinical care but we don‚Äôt use them to monitor outbreaks,‚Äù Trepka said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, new tests ‚Äî like one from Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche that the Food and Drug Administration authorized on March 13 ‚Äî are under development. The Roche test is 10 times faster at producing results than the standard PCR system. But unlike the PCR test, it requires the use of a rare (and proprietary) instrument. There are only 110 of these machines in the whole country. And that test still requires reagents, Smith said. As big companies like Roche bring these kinds of testing systems online, they‚Äôre sucking up the already limited quantities of reagent that smaller labs need for PCR tests. These big companies, such as Roche, are also making more reagent, Smith said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs very much profit-driven and they can corner the market very quickly,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the end of the world, but it‚Äôs hard in the middle of the epidemic.‚Äù\\n\\nCORRECTION (March 24, 2020, 9:43 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the scientific definitions of sensitive and specific.

Researchers and officials cite statistical models that estimate infection rates, death counts and when things will go back to normal, but those estimates are changing rapidly. And as the forecasts bounce around, so do the rest of us living through the crisis. How can one feel settled when the future feels so volatile?\\n\\nStill, there‚Äôs a way to at least get a sense for what the experts are thinking. For the past five weeks, infectious disease researchers from institutions around the United States have been taking a survey that gathers their thoughts on the trajectory of the COVID-19 virus. The researchers come from academia, government and industry and are experts in modeling the spread of viruses like this one. The survey asks about things like how many people will eventually get COVID-19 and how many Americans will die.\\n\\nThe top-line numbers are sobering. The most recent survey, taken on March 16 and 17, found that, as a group, the experts think that as of March 15, only 12 percent of infections in the U.S. had been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They think there‚Äôs a 73 percent chance of a second wave of hospitalizations this fall. And they expect approximately 200,000 deaths in the U.S. by the end of the year.\\n\\nBut averages can only tell you so much. When forecasting the future, it also matters what a person (or model) thinks the range of possibilities could be ‚Äî how uncertain the forecast is, in other words. In this survey, the experts gave three answers to most questions, representing the most likely future scenario and the best-case and worst-case scenarios.\\n\\nCollecting responses in this form captures both the best-guess estimate from each respondent and the uncertainty surrounding it. It also lets the people in charge of the survey ‚Äî Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts Amherst ‚Äî convert the responses to a probabilistic consensus forecast, something that can answer questions like, ‚ÄúAccording to these researchers, what is the probability that we will have 50,000 reported cases by March 29?‚Äù\\n\\nExpert consensus forecasts give you what a model does ‚Äî a forecast that gives a measure of its uncertainty ‚Äî without being overly reliant on just one way of thinking about a problem. In this instance, each expert has their own assumptions about how likely the virus is to spread or to be fatal, as well as assumptions about the ways humans might try to mitigate its damage.\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what the researchers collectively had to say in the March 16-17 survey.\\n\\nHow many total COVID-19 cases in the U.S. will the CDC report on March 29?\\n\\nAt the time the survey was in the field, about 3,500 cases had been reported. But the experts estimated that by Sunday, March 29 ‚Äî a little under two weeks after they took the survey ‚Äî the country would have seen anywhere from 10,000 to 75,000 cases. (The current count is 15,219.) The experts‚Äô confidence in those estimates, however, varied greatly:\\n\\nAndrew Lover, an epidemiologist from the University of Massachusetts who took the survey, said his estimates were ‚Äúsemi-quantitative‚Äù and based on the virus‚Äôs progression in other countries. ‚ÄúThe doubling times have been 5-8 days most places, so it‚Äôs a matter of applying that with some sliding-scale adjustments (testing rates, population density, etc.) based on the ‚Äòfeel‚Äô of the epidemic curves.‚Äù\\n\\nThe consensus forecast generated by the individual responses indicates that we should expect roughly 19,000 reported cases by March 29, with an 80 percent chance of seeing between 10,500 and 81,500 cases.\\n\\nWhat percentage of all COVID-19 cases in the U.S. had been reported as of March 15?\\n\\nExperts estimated that, on March 15, when the CDC had publicly identified about 3,500 cases, only between 5 percent and 40 percent of actual COVID-19 cases had been reported. But experts‚Äô confidence in those numbers was shaky.\\n\\nThe consensus model indicates that only 12 percent of cases had been reported at that time. In other words, the researchers think there were actually about 29,000 infections in the U.S. as of March 15, more than eight times the known tally.\\n\\nHow likely is it that there will be a second wave of hospitalizations later this year?\\n\\nJust as flu season can have two peaks, the surveyed experts think there‚Äôs a good chance there will be a second wave of coronavirus-related hospitalizations sometime between August and December. Individual estimates for the likelihood of that second round of cases ranged from 40 percent to 96 percent, with an expert consensus of a 73 percent chance.\\n\\nHow many people will die in the U.S. due to COVID-19 this year?\\n\\nExperts‚Äô estimates of the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. in 2020 ranged from 4,000 all the way to 1 million, a huge range that highlights how much we still don‚Äôt know about this disease.\\n\\nThe expert consensus is to expect about 200,000 deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 this year, but the uncertainty around that number is also huge: There‚Äôs an 80 percent chance the final number will be between 19,000 and 1.2 million, according to these estimates.\\n\\nThe researchers plan to continue conducting these weekly surveys. As some elements of the pandemic become clearer ‚Äî such as the virus‚Äôs incubation period and fatality rate, and how far the U.S. is willing to go to slow the spread of the virus ‚Äî these ranges will presumably narrow.\\n\\nBut for now, there‚Äôs a lot the experts still aren‚Äôt certain of.

Mike DeWine was the first governor in the country to shutter bars and restaurants statewide, forcing patrons to dine at home. But even before DeWine‚Äôs March 15 order, restaurants were already feeling the impact of the coronavirus as customers began to avoid crowded areas in their cities.\\n\\nThat chart shows the year-over-year change in seated diners, according to data from OpenTable, an online restaurant reservation platform. OpenTable services almost 60,000 restaurants worldwide, including 35 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., and while its data is not a random sample it does offer a glimpse into what‚Äôs happening in the restaurant industry nationwide. And what‚Äôs happening is not good.\\n\\nMany restaurants are now paralyzed. Governors across the country have issued executive orders restricting or prohibiting seated dining in restaurants ‚Äî 33 states so far, though all of the states are allowing take-away or delivery orders. The majority of these closures have come on the heels of updated guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending people avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people.\\n\\nBut no matter whether the governor has issued an order or not, restaurants in every state available in the OpenTable data set have experienced declining dining attendance over the last two weeks. As public pleas for social distancing get louder, diners are forced to order food for take-away or delivery, or simply to cook at home.\\n\\nDiminishing clientele ‚Äî and the diminishing profits that result ‚Äî make it unsustainable for many restaurants to stay open and maintain fixed costs, let alone continue to pay wages. Some restaurants prepared to close even before the shutdowns took effect, citing consideration for the health and safety of the community.\\n\\nThose that try to stay open have been fighting against a whiplash of regulatory changes. Restaurants in New York City, for example, which were told they had to cut capacity by 50 percent on March 13. Just three days later, they were forced to close their doors to diners altogether. Restaurateur David Chang, owner of the worldwide Momofuku restaurant group, noted the absurdity in drumming up a new, pared-back business model in the midst of a crisis and mocked the idea that pick-up and delivery would be a Band-Aid for forced closures.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs no secret many workers in the food and beverage and service industries live paycheck to paycheck and, as my colleagues pointed out this week, are among the most vulnerable in an economic crisis. And filing for unemployment can be a tedious process, because waiting periods and benefits vary state by state. Many business owners are still struggling to decide whether to furlough, lay off or hold on to employees in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, which only creates more uncertainty for Americans about next steps. Amendments to the current process for filing unemployment (like these in North Carolina or these in New York) will be vital for the wave of workers who have lost their jobs.\\n\\nAs states continue to order restaurant closures, we‚Äôll almost certainly see more abrupt drops in patronship like we saw in Ohio. To soften the economic blow, advocacy and nonprofit groups are calling for relief funds and resources to support laid-off workers and small business owners.

One thing that hasn‚Äôt changed: the U.S. is still short on coronavirus tests. While the administration says supply has increased, many sick Americans are still having trouble finding a way to know if they have coronavirus.\\n\\nThere were clear benefits to robust testing early in the spread of the virus. But now that we‚Äôve missed that window, it might seem like testing is less of a priority, at least in areas where the virus is already widespread. After all, if we‚Äôre all behaving as though everyone around us already has COVID-19, as New York City officials reportedly told U.N. delegations they should, why do we need to know who actually does?\\n\\nBut there‚Äôs still much that can be learned ‚Äî and lives that could be saved ‚Äî by increasing testing across the country immediately. And in fact, the social distancing measures being taken right now are as much to make up for not testing sooner as they are to slow the virus‚Äô spread. Here are four ways that widespread testing is still a critical step in our coronavirus defense:\\n\\n1. Testing helps allocate resources\\n\\n‚ÄúThis is basic disease surveillance,‚Äù said Gregg Gonsalves, a microbial disease epidemiologist at Yale University. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt begin to control this epidemic unless we know where this is and how many cases we‚Äôve got.‚Äù\\n\\nGonsalves said testing tells officials where to allocate resources. We do not have an unlimited supply of things like ventilators, which can be used to help treat severe cases of the infection. If we know which areas will be hardest hit now and in the weeks to come, we can allocate federal funds and supplies to those areas so they‚Äôll be able to administer better care, Gonsalves said.\\n\\nAnd while it may seem obvious that a densely populated area like New York City is likely to have a higher infection rate than a county in rural Montana, Gonsalves said population is not a good enough predictor of where the disease will strike hardest or first.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt could be New York. It could be L.A. It could be Chicago. It could be St. Louis,‚Äù Gonsalves said. ‚ÄúPopulation isn‚Äôt a great way to predict who will have the greatest number of cases per capita.‚Äù\\n\\n2. It saves time and equipment in hospitals\\n\\nAlong with allowing us to better allocate resources, knowing who is or is not infected with the virus will allow hospitals to use the equipment and supplies they already have more efficiently, according to Dr. W. Graham Carlos, chief of internal medicine at Eskenazi Health in Indianapolis.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhen somebody comes into the hospital who does not have a known positive diagnosis, we have to rule it out,‚Äù Carlos said.\\n\\nWhile waiting for test results, patients have to be treated as if they are infectious, Carlos said, meaning health care workers have to use personal protective equipment like gowns, gloves and face masks whenever dealing with that patient. If a patient doesn‚Äôt have COVID-19, those supplies could have been saved for someone who does.\\n\\nIf widespread testing was done outside of a hospital setting ‚Äî such as at drive-through test sites like in South Korea ‚Äî it would save not only equipment, but valuable time for hospital workers treating critical patients, Carlos said.\\n\\n‚ÄúIf we already know you‚Äôre positive, that saves time too,‚Äù Carlos said. ‚ÄúWe have treatments coming online and we may be more apt to do those things if we have a diagnosis already.‚Äù\\n\\n3. It makes social distancing more effective\\n\\nSocial distancing, a now-ubiquitous term many of us had never even heard of until just a few weeks ago, has been one of the main tools deployed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù of its impact.\\n\\nBut social distancing is a voluntary practice, one that many Americans can‚Äôt, or won‚Äôt, observe right now. One way to encourage more people to stay home, or governments to start shutting things down, is telling Americans exactly how bad the outbreak is. While many places in the U.S. have started enacting measures to limit social gatherings, like closing bars, restaurants and theaters, it‚Äôs not a universal practice. Without knowing where the virus is spreading, we can‚Äôt say whether the municipalities that ought to be shutting down are doing so.\\n\\nThere‚Äôs also the fact that, eventually, we‚Äôre going to want to go back outside again. As the current protocols start to relax, a second wave of infections may arise, especially if we don‚Äôt have a good grasp on where and how many cases we have in the U.S., said Dr. Eli Perencevich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Iowa.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay in social distancing forever,‚Äù Perencevich said. ‚ÄúSo we need to ramp up testing quickly.‚Äù\\n\\nPerencevich and Gonsalves both said the current measures are really a way for us to make up for the time lost by not having widespread testing sooner. They said that if we don‚Äôt rapidly scale up testing now, all this staying at home and canceling sports events may be for naught, because we still won‚Äôt know how bad the outbreak is and won‚Äôt be able to respond appropriately. Staying inside gives us the opportunity to get caught up on testing, an opportunity these experts don‚Äôt want to squander.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been out of the containment phase for a month, ‚Äú Gonsalves said. ‚ÄúThis is no longer about bending the curve in terms of number of infections. We won‚Äôt bend the curve of the number of infections. But we might bend the curve of the number of deaths.‚Äù\\n\\n4. It provides helpful data going forward\\n\\nWhile it‚Äôs hard to imagine right now, eventually we will be through the worst of this pandemic. At that point, our attention will start to turn from emergency measures to long-term responses, like what treatments or vaccines might help protect us from COVID-19 outbreaks in the future, and how we can avoid similar pandemics.\\n\\nTo make any of those predictions, we need data ‚Äî and the most basic information we‚Äôll need is knowing how many people were infected and where.\\n\\n‚ÄúWhen we look at this retrospectively, knowing that is going to be important,‚Äù said Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University. ‚ÄúThe data we need to look at the genomics of the virus, who transmitted to whom, who sparked clusters in new areas, we get all of that data from testing.‚Äù\\n\\nThis can also help us measure how effective different measures are at combating this kind of viral outbreak, Smith said.\\n\\nBut in order to get a solid grasp on the spread, we need to drastically ramp up testing. Currently, just under 59,000 tests have been completed in the U.S., according to The COVID Tracking Project, a database created by Related Sciences and The Atlantic. Compare that to South Korea, where 10,000 people can be tested every single day.\\n\\nWhile testing is scaling up, we‚Äôre still not there yet. The American Clinical Laboratory Association said in a press release last week that as more commercial labs come online, they will be able to exceed 280,000 tests per week, but won‚Äôt reach that full capacity until April 1. Quest Diagnostics, a private lab company that is currently scaling up operations, said it expects to be able to perform 10,000 tests per day by the end of the week and 20,000 tests per day by the end of the month.\\n\\nSmith said that‚Äôs the scale we ought to be operating at in order to get the needed data.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre bigger than South Korea. We have a higher population and we should have the technical capacity to do this,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúBut we are so behind the curve.‚Äù', 'author': ['Kaleigh Rogers']}, {'link': 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-workers-are-most-vulnerable-to-the-economic-costs-of-the-coronavirus/', 'published': '2020-03-18T15:53:31', 'title': 'Which Workers Are Most Vulnerable To The Economic Costs Of The Coronavirus?', 'text': 'Kolby Ledbetter, 25, began worrying about the new coronavirus a few weeks ago, when it became clear that it was starting to spread in the United States.

J.B. Pritzker announced that all bars and restaurants would be shut down for dine-in customers through the end of March. The bar where Ledbetter works closed the next day, leaving him with a whole new set of worries. ‚ÄúEven before all of this coronavirus stuff, I had a lot of financial anxiety because I was basically living paycheck to paycheck,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow I have a lot of worry about my health, but I‚Äôm also terrified about my ability to stay afloat financially even if I don‚Äôt get sick.‚Äù\\n\\nAs dramatic measures to tamp down the spread of the virus are implemented across the country, workers like Ledbetter will likely be among the first to feel the economic effects. Big retailers like Gap and Columbia Sportswear are cutting their hours or shutting down entirely in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. And bars and restaurants have also been closed or restricted in a number of states beyond Illinois. On Monday, President Trump urged Americans in a press conference to avoid congregating in groups of more than 10 people.\\n\\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers like Ledbetter could be especially hard hit economically by the coronavirus, as part-time workers, very young or old workers, and workers in the lowest quartile of earnings are disproportionately likely to work in service industry or sales jobs.\\n\\nMartha Ross, a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution who studies the labor market, told us that workers like Ledbetter have few economic protections right now. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of folks who don‚Äôt get paid leave if they get sick. They probably can‚Äôt work remotely, so they‚Äôre more likely to get sick if they do go to work,‚Äù said Ross. ‚ÄúAnd even if they don‚Äôt get the virus, they‚Äôre still at higher risk of losing their jobs or having their hours cut. They‚Äôre vulnerable no matter what happens.‚Äù\\n\\nCrises have a way of exposing inequalities that linger uncomfortably below the surface when times are good. A few groups of workers are particularly likely to lack both paid leave and the ability to work from home: part-time workers, the youngest and oldest people in the workforce (those under the age of 25 and over the age of 65) and workers who fall below the 25th percentile of earnings.\\n\\nWho is economically vulnerable to the coronavirus?

Workers over the age of 65 ‚Äî who are also at elevated risk of a life-threatening infection because of their age ‚Äî only make up about 5 percent of people with jobs, for instance. But part-time workers make up about 20 percent. Some of these groups may overlap ‚Äî young workers, for example, are disproportionately likely to be part-time workers ‚Äî but they still represent a sizable chunk of the country‚Äôs workforce.\\n\\nMany of these workers are employed in jobs that will be hard-hit by the recent wave of closures and cancellations, too. Almost one-third of part-time workers are employed in the service industry, which includes people who work in food preparation, and 25 percent work in sales. About 40 percent of workers under the age of 25 are employed in service or sales, too. Other research suggests that contingent workers ‚Äî independent contractors, freelancers, or other people who work in the ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù ‚Äî are disproportionately likely to be affected, since they‚Äôre more likely to be young and to work part-time. And they typically have no access to paid leave or other benefits because their employment is only temporary. They also tend to make less than workers in traditional, permanent jobs.

People who don‚Äôt have access to paid leave and the ability to work remotely are disproportionately likely to be low-income, which means if their workplace isn‚Äôt shuttered, they‚Äôre more likely to keep coming to work out of necessity, even if they‚Äôre not feeling well. That can put them at greater risk of being infected, since their coworkers may be doing the same thing. Research has found some workers in the food service industry kept coming to work even though they had symptoms of norovirus because they were afraid of losing their job or leaving their coworkers short-staffed.\\n\\nAnd the possibility that many will lose their jobs or have their hours cut because of the coronavirus creates a whole new set of problems. A survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation from March 11 to 15 found that 73 percent of workers with a household income of less than $40,000 a year, 68 percent of part-time workers, and 60 percent of self-employed workers are worried that they will lose income due to a workplace closure or reduced hours because of the coronavirus. According to that survey, part-time and self-employed workers are likelier than full-time or salaried workers to say they‚Äôve already lost income so far.\\n\\nIf the shutdowns persist, some employers may go out of business, leaving workers who weren‚Äôt permanently laid off with no job to return to. ‚ÄúWe have to start thinking about what‚Äôs going to happen when people can‚Äôt pay their rent or mortgage,‚Äù Rothstein said. ‚ÄúBecause these workers are going to start burning through their savings ‚Äî if they have any at all.‚Äù\\n\\nCORRECTION (March 18, 2020, 4:26 p.m.): A previous version of this article gave an incorrect number for the share of part-time workers.

The Next One Will Be Worse.', 'text': 'Well, it took 10 years, but the streak is over: There was a net loss of American jobs last month. That‚Äôs putting it mildly, actually. Today, the first jobs report encompassing the economic fallout from COVID-19 was released and, predictably, it paints a dire picture. Overall, 701,000 fewer people are employed now than last month ‚Äî the first time in a decade that number has declined. The unemployment rate ‚Äî which has remained below 4 percent since January 2019 ‚Äî has risen to 4.4 percent.\\n\\nBut this is just a glimpse of what‚Äôs to come. Next month‚Äôs report will almost certainly be far worse, and this month‚Äôs will likely be revised down in the months to come.\\n\\nBut one thing we know with relative certainty: The situation will get worse before it gets better. The household survey, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to estimate the unemployment rate, was in the field the second week of March. While some businesses had already shut down temporarily by then, plenty of areas ‚Äî some of the most populated areas, in fact ‚Äî hadn‚Äôt yet called for closures. Six counties in the Bay Area, for example, had yet to announce a shelter-in-place mandate, and New York Gov. Andrew Coumo had yet to ‚Äúput New York on pause,‚Äù requiring all nonessential businesses to close down public-facing storefronts.\\n\\nSo, if you can, look beyond this month‚Äôs job report and ask yourself: Just how bad will the next report be? And what will an economic recovery look like?\\n\\nUnemployment insurance claims, which are reported weekly, can help provide a sense of where we might be headed.\\n\\nAs the previous chart shows, there were 282,000 claims for the week the statistics bureau found an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent. After that, however, the number grew substantially. It stands to reason, then, that the true unemployment rate is much higher.\\n\\nOne piece of good news: Matt McDonald, a partner at the consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies who writes a monthly analysis of the jobs report, says we have reason to believe that job growth will be as dramatic as the fall. A typical economic recession‚Äôs recovery takes a U shape. That is, job losses level off at the bottom for several months before the country eventually adds jobs again. He expects to see something closer to a V shape. ‚ÄúI would guess that after the business closures get lifted, you‚Äôre going to have a positive jobs report as a result of that ‚Äî because you have to,‚Äù McDonald said, citing the nature of businesses reopening all at once.\\n\\nIf the $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at helping those economically hurt by the coronavirus can offer enough leeway for businesses to wait this out, shops could rehire their staff as quickly as they let them go.\\n\\nThere‚Äôs no guarantee that the current stimulus packages will be enough, however. For any businesses running on thin margins, forgoing a few months of profit can be catastrophic. Even if they are financially equipped to do so, fear that the market will stay dicey might cause employers to act cautiously. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have people moving into a defensive position in the economy, just assuming that this is going to be a longer fall,‚Äù McDonald said. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre going to have layoffs for that reason.‚Äù\\n\\nBut, ultimately, we are still too far out to have any true grip on what kind of economic fallout we‚Äôre facing. My former colleague Ben Casselman put it well on our politics podcast last week: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre kind of flying blind here for a while in terms of the real impact of this. It‚Äôs just faster than our economic data can keep up.‚Äù', 'author': ['Julia Wolfe']}, {'link': 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/unemployment-filings-hit-6-6-million-doubling-last-weeks-record-high/', 'published': '2020-04-02T13:13:47', 'title': 'Unemployment Filings Hit 6.6 Million, Doubling Last Week‚Äôs Record High', 'text': 'Last week saw record-high unemployment numbers ‚Äî an astronomical 3.3 million Americans filed initial claims between March 15 and March 21. But today‚Äôs data from the Department of Labor painted a much, much bleaker picture for the job market. During the week ending on March 28, 6.6 million more people filed for unemployment insurance, double the number from last week and nearly 6 million more than the all-time high from before a week ago.\\n\\nMany of those claims were left over from a backlog of people unable to file during the initial wave of coronavirus-related layoffs. As we noted last week, state unemployment agencies have never needed to process anywhere near this many claims at once, and the strain was apparent in widespread reports that out-of-work Americans were struggling to file through computer glitches.\\n\\nBut this week‚Äôs initial claims also reflect the ongoing vulnerability of American workers amid shelter-in-place orders and other social-distancing measures designed to slow the coronavirus‚Äôs spread. According to research by economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, about 50 million jobs could eventually be lost due to the virus and the economic challenges it presents. These include jobs in sales, food preparation and other services, plus ‚Äúhigh contact-intensive‚Äù positions such as flight attendants and hairdressers.\\n\\nSo as the crisis wears on, initial unemployment claim numbers that once seemed unthinkable could become the norm.\\n\\n‚ÄúThese are very large numbers by historical standards,‚Äù Faria-e-Castro wrote, ‚Äúbut this is a rather unique shock that is unlike any other experienced by the U.S. economy in the last 100 years.‚Äù\\n\\nFaria-e-Castro did point out that the duration of this unemployment crisis also matters. And to that point, other economists have noted that a large number of these job losses could be erased once the virus clears and returning to work is feasible again ‚Äî particularly since many of the unemployment claims are from workers who have been furloughed or only temporarily left unpaid.\\n\\nIn an interview with CNBC last week, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard predicted a boom in the overall economy once the pandemic subsides because of what he termed ‚Äúpent-up demand‚Äù during the inactivity of social distancing. That would include, he said, a return to relatively normal unemployment numbers after the big spikes of this quarter.\\n\\nBut the simple truth is that experts ‚Äî whether in economics or epidemiology ‚Äî don‚Äôt really know the ultimate trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly with regard to when cases will peak and tail off, a crucial factor for reopening the economy. It‚Äôs an exceptionally difficult problem to model, as my colleagues Maggie Koerth, Laura Bronner and Jasmine Mithani wrote this week. And even if large numbers of the jobs lost this month are eventually restored, there‚Äôs a good chance that this economic shock will still affect Americans‚Äô earnings for years to come, especially for recent graduates.\\n\\nFor now, that means economists will keep watching the unemployment figures as a way of gauging where we are in the crisis ‚Äî and they‚Äôll keep readjusting their benchmarks to this new, never-seen-before normal.\\n\\nStaying Home Saves Lives.

On Thursday, a Department of Labor report showed that a record-shattering 3.3 million people applied for initial unemployment claims last week. And with entire industries shuttered for the foreseeable future, economic output will almost certainly shrink dramatically.\\n\\nAs economic forecasts grow darker, talk of tradeoffs is getting louder: Is protecting Americans from COVID-19 really worth all this disruption and economic pain?\\n\\nOn March 22, before President Trump floated the idea of reopening the economy by Easter, against the recommendations of his own public health experts, he tweeted, ‚ÄúWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.‚Äù Other politicians, meanwhile, rejected the idea that economic costs should be a factor at all. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo dismissed Trump‚Äôs push to get the economy moving again, saying, ‚ÄúNo American is going to say, ‚Äòaccelerate the economy at the cost of human life.‚Äô Because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.‚Äù\\n\\nCuomo‚Äôs sentiment might be a nice bit of political rhetoric, but it‚Äôs not really true. Economists might not be able to say how much an individual person‚Äôs existence is worth, but they have figured out a way to calculate how much the average person is willing to pay to reduce the risk of death ‚Äî which allows them to put a price tag on the collective value of saving one life. That figure, which currently hovers somewhere around $9 or $10 million, is known as the ‚Äúvalue of statistical life,‚Äù and it‚Äôs the basis for all kinds of high-stakes decisions that involve tradeoffs between public safety and economic cost ‚Äî from food and automobile regulations to our responses to climate change.\\n\\nAs cold-blooded as it might seem, several economists told me that, at least in theory, a pandemic is exactly the kind of situation this metric is designed to help with. ‚ÄúEssentially, we‚Äôre trying to figure out what our society is willing to pay to reduce the risk of mortality,‚Äù said W. Kip Viscusi, an economist at Vanderbilt University and one of the leading experts on these calculations. ‚ÄúIn that sense, a pandemic isn‚Äôt so different from a terrorist attack or a pollutant that‚Äôs threatening to kill large numbers of people ‚Äî it‚Äôs just happening very quickly and on a very large scale.‚Äù\\n\\nThe idea that a life could have a monetary value isn‚Äôt necessarily easy to swallow from an ethical perspective. Economists and government regulators have to balance the risk of death against all kinds of other factors, though, and the concept of the VSL was developed several decades ago because economists didn‚Äôt like the idea of assigning that value through other, more intuitive means, like our contributions to the economy as workers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fairly simple to value someone‚Äôs life based on how much money they make,‚Äù said Spencer Banzhaf, an economist at Georgia State University who has written about the history of the VSL. ‚ÄúBut in addition to being baldly crude, that‚Äôs just not reflective of the way we think about people. We don‚Äôt think a retired person is worth nothing.‚Äù\\n\\nThe VSL, instead of trying to sum up the value of a life, approaches the question from the other direction ‚Äî how much are we willing to spend to reduce the odds of dying?\\n\\nEconomists draw the numbers from multiple sources, including surveys and assumptions about our own choices, like how much additional money people earn for especially dangerous jobs, or how much a premium they‚Äôll pay for a safer car. The estimates do vary, but they fall in the same basic range ‚Äî the EPA‚Äôs valuation falls around $9.4 million, while Viscusi‚Äôs latest calculation is $10 million. To put it another way, Viscusi‚Äôs estimate means that if a group of 10,000 people is facing a 1-in-10,000 risk of death, they‚Äôre willing to pay $1,000 per person to reduce the odds that any given member of the community will die.\\n\\nThese numbers show why spending trillions of dollars to combat a threat like the coronavirus pandemic can be a good investment, despite the high cost. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say one of our worst-case scenarios comes to pass, and 2 million people die,‚Äù said James Hammitt, an economist at Harvard‚Äôs T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. ‚ÄúMultiply that by $9 million or $10 million and we‚Äôre talking about up to $20 trillion as the value of preventing those deaths. That suggests it‚Äôs worth expending a fair amount of our resources to mitigate this.‚Äù\\n\\nBut back-of-the-envelope calculations can obscure some of the knottier questions that plague economists who have studied this issue for decades. The VSL varies by country, because the wealth of the average person in a rich country like the United States is much higher than that of a person in a poorer country like India, which means Americans can ‚Äúpay‚Äù more to avoid risk. That outcome is liable to make most people uncomfortable, and weighing the value of other types of lives ‚Äî for example, the young versus the old ‚Äî is tricky, too.\\n\\nFor example, even though the coronavirus appears to result in a much higher mortality rate for older people ‚Äî prompting some politicians to propose that they should consider sacrificing themselves to save the economy ‚Äî trying to put a lower price tag on their lives hasn‚Äôt worked well in the past. Joseph Aldy, a public policy professor at Harvard‚Äôs Kennedy School of Government, said that under President George W. Bush, the EPA tried to put a lower value on the life of an older person in calculating the benefits of air quality regulations. In their analysis, the life of a person over the age of 70 was worth 37 percent less than the life of a younger person.\\n\\n‚ÄúIt was a political disaster,‚Äù Aldy said. The policy was christened the ‚Äúsenior death discount‚Äù and in response, AARP ran ads featuring a picture of an elderly woman with a ‚Äú37 percent OFF!‚Äù tag hanging from her glasses. The EPA backed off and never implemented the proposed changes.\\n\\nOutside the glare of the political spotlight, though, that experience hasn‚Äôt stopped economists from exploring whether age-based valuations are right in some circumstances. There‚Äôs evidence, Aldy said, that people‚Äôs willingness to pay to reduce the risk of mortality starts to decrease after age 50. But those kinds of calculations, he added, are sometimes disconnected from the moral valuations we make collectively. ‚ÄúWe spend the vast majority of our health care dollars on people over the age of 65, and yet one might say the age-adjusted value of statistical life for that population is lower,‚Äù Aldy said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a kind of social compact ‚Äî we recognize your contributions to our society and will provide the resources to keep you healthy as you age. So how far can this economic analysis really go when we‚Äôve made that decision as a society?‚Äù\\n\\nAnd even accounting for age might not provide a compelling argument against the measures currently being taken in response to the pandemic. Two economists used age-adjusted VSL in a recent analysis of the economic cost of social distancing ‚Äî and they still found that the public health response to coronavirus had ‚Äúsubstantial economic benefits.‚Äù\\n\\nThe sheer uncertainty of the coronavirus crisis is another problem ‚Äî both in terms of the potential death toll and economic impact. Estimates of how many people might die in the U.S. are all over the place ‚Äî some as low as 200,000, others as high as 2 million. And Banzhaf said that just as age-based calculations have their limitations, the scope of the economic costs has to go beyond earnings or GDP. ‚ÄúDepending on how long this shutdown goes on, we‚Äôre talking about a huge hit to the common good and our way of life,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf symphonies, hotels, art galleries, restaurants close and can‚Äôt come back ‚Äî that‚Äôs a loss that goes way beyond earnings dollars. I don‚Äôt know how you begin to quantify it.‚Äù\\n\\nIf anything, though, the uncertainty and fear of the coronavirus pandemic could drive the value of statistical life even higher. Studies have shown, Hammitt said, that because people are more afraid of flying on airplanes than driving in cars, they are willing to shell out for airplane safety measures. ‚ÄúWe see the same thing with terrorism risk,‚Äù Hammitt said. ‚ÄúWhen a kind of death is more dreaded or ambiguous, people are willing to pay more to avoid dying that way.‚Äù\\n\\nBut Aldy told me that cost-benefit analyses would have been most helpful at earlier stages of the crisis, when the government had the opportunity to invest in testing and surveillance. At this point, he told me, he wasn‚Äôt sure why a cost-benefit analysis was needed to drive home the cost of a huge loss of life ‚Äî particularly since he, like many other economists and public health experts, thinks that containing the virus is the best way to ensure the economy rebounds quickly.\\n\\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say we‚Äôre talking about 1 million deaths or 2 million deaths,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen you think about the economic damage and the damage to families and communities all over the country, I don‚Äôt think you need an egghead like me to try to put a price on that. It‚Äôs catastrophic.‚Äù\\n\\nCORRECTION (March 27, 2020, 12:35 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the odds required for 10,000 people being willing to pay $1,000 per person to reduce the odds that any given member of the community will die.

Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project (a nonprofit devoted to labor and employment advocacy), told me via email that many people who have tried to file claims so far have been unable to, even if they qualify for unemployment. Evermore said state unemployment agencies weren‚Äôt set up to handle this volume of claims, and that has led to breakdowns in their filing systems. ‚ÄúI think they have responded admirably, but computer failures and glitches have been widely reported,‚Äù she wrote.\\n\\nThis implies that, on top of the current record-breaking numbers, the totals in future weeks could include a backlog of people who were unable to file their initial claims over the past few weeks.

As a few of my colleagues wrote about last week, workers in the food and service industries (particularly in restaurants) are at a heightened economic risk during this crisis, since those businesses are inherently at odds with the type of social distancing edicts many states have issued. But at the same time, it stands to reason that some industries will actually be hiring more workers as the pandemic rages on.\\n\\nThe topline numbers, though, are undeniably bad. According to the Department of Labor, seasonally adjusted initial unemployment insurance claims leaped by 70,000 ‚Äî to 281,000 total ‚Äî for the week ending March 14. That number alone would be historic; only 13 weeks since 1967 have ever seen a week-over-week increase of 70,000 or more claims, and this is just the third time it‚Äôs happened since 1996. But the numbers that will come out this week could be unlike anything we‚Äôve ever seen. Analysts are projecting that the total number of initial claims for the week ending on March 21 could rise above 2 million, an unthinkably high number. (Since 1967, no single week had ever seen 700,000 initial claims, according to the Federal Reserve.)\\n\\nBut again, it can be easy to forget that not every sector of the economy is affected the same way by this tidal wave of unemployment. To get an early sense of where any additional jobs might come from, FiveThirtyEight reached out to Carrie Engel of Indeed, a job search and posting website. Indeed‚Äôs analytics confirmed the overall direction of the federal job-market data above; through March 21, the year-over-year trend in job postings for the U.S. was down 7.2 percent. That could get worse before it gets better ‚Äî the trend is down 18.2 percent from last year in Italy, a country that has instituted public lockdowns as its death toll rises. According to Indeed, U.S. postings in tourism and aviation are also significantly down from a year ago, reflecting other sectors of the economy that have been battered by travel bans and citizens generally staying inside.\\n\\nBut Indeed‚Äôs numbers show a 5 percent increase in job postings for loading and stocking workers ‚Äî warehouse jobs necessary for online delivery companies such as Amazon, which announced last week that it was opening 100,000 new roles and doubling down on shipments for coronavirus-related supplies. Of course, these numbers might be complicated by news of a confirmed coronavirus case in one of Amazon‚Äôs warehouses and reports that package delivery workers are sick on the job.\\n\\nEngel also pointed to another area where Indeed had noticed an upward trend of job postings: medical jobs. ‚ÄúPostings for jobs in the medical technician field, which includes titles such as medical assistant and laboratory technician, are growing faster this year, 7 percent above their trend at this point in 2019,‚Äù she wrote in an email.\\n\\nShe also noted that, before the crisis, Indeed‚Äôs data indicated fewer job seekers interested in medical positions than there had been just a few years earlier, particularly in metropolitan areas with a larger share of people aged 65 or older. Now, those health care workers are needed more than ever, which could lead to an increase in hiring.\\n\\nWhat about job postings in other industries that are more conducive to working from home, such as technology fields that are digital-only? Although Indeed hadn‚Äôt taken a comprehensive survey yet, Engel said software development jobs are growing more slowly in 2020, with a posting trend about 2 percent lower than last year. So for now, there hasn‚Äôt been a particular spike in hiring for at least one of the areas that might be able to expand, free of social-distancing constraints.\\n\\nOne unknown factor in the job equation could also be applied over the weeks to come: the Defense Production Act (DPA). We‚Äôve already seen some factories that make perfume and alcohol willingly convert production to health products currently in short supply, such as hand sanitizer. But the DPA gives the federal government wide latitude over private companies, including the ability to compel them to fill orders necessary for the national defense before completing their usual products. In theory, this would provide for mass industrial production of masks, gloves, ventilators and other medical equipment needed to manage the crisis. What is unclear is whether this ramp-up in production would also lead to the creation of more jobs or would simply reallocate existing workers to new tasks.\\n\\nBecause of the coronavirus, the overall job market looks bleak in a way we haven‚Äôt seen in decades, if ever. But as businesses adjust to the new reality of the pandemic, it‚Äôs worth keeping an eye on jobs numbers for sectors that either are directly involved in the fight against the virus or are poised to see more business with the public staying inside.', 'author': ['Neil Paine']}, {'link': 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stimulus-checks-arent-a-bad-idea-but-theyre-not-enough/', 'published': '2020-03-23T19:29:25', 'title': 'Stimulus Checks Aren‚Äôt A Bad Idea, But They‚Äôre Not Enough', 'text': 'Congress is about to embark on a huge spending spree.

The unemployment crisis is unfolding at a terrifying speed, and people need money. So why not simply give it to them? There‚Äôs also some evidence that the checks are increasingly popular with Americans as the massive economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic comes into focus. A poll conducted March 16-17 by liberal think tank Data for Progress showed that support for $1,000 cash payments to Americans has skyrocketed since early March, with 58 percent of the country now in favor.\\n\\nBut is an influx of cash actually the best way to cushion workers from what seems likely to be the most dramatic shock in recent memory? The consensus, based on my conversations with almost a dozen economic experts, is that it can‚Äôt hurt to go ahead and send out checks. But that probably shouldn‚Äôt be our only ‚Äî or even our primary ‚Äî economic response. There are preexisting systems, like unemployment insurance programs, that can quickly get money to the people who are losing their jobs. And in the short term, focusing on shoring up those systems could be just as important as determining how big a windfall Americans should get in the mail.\\n\\n‚ÄúRight now, the risk of overreach is negligible and the risk of doing too little is very high,‚Äù said Indivar Dutta-Gupta, the co-director of the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality. ‚ÄúSo stimulus checks should really just be one part of a much broader effort to help the tens of millions of people who are going to be hurt economically by this pandemic.‚Äù\\n\\nOn Thursday, after the Senate Republicans‚Äô economic proposal was unveiled, Republican Sen.

Extra funding for the unemployment system is one of the options Congress is considering.\\n\\nHe had a surprising amount of company among some of the left-leaning experts I spoke with, who said the unemployment insurance system needs a lot of help. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not opposed to sending out checks, but it‚Äôs not an especially efficient way of helping people right now,‚Äù said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. ‚ÄúWe have a system that is literally designed to help people who have become unemployed, so we should be focusing on making sure that system is capable of responding to the huge surge of people who are relying on it.‚Äù\\n\\nShoring up the unemployment insurance system came up in almost every conversation I had. And that‚Äôs because the system is already threatening to buckle as the number of people applying for unemployment benefits spikes. According to the Department of Labor, new filings for job losses rose 33 percent for the week ending on March 14. And that data doesn‚Äôt even cover last week, when businesses across the country temporarily shuttered and a tidal wave of layoffs followed. The state offices that administer unemployment benefits are unprepared to meet the demand in multiple ways ‚Äî across the country last week, websites crashed, phone lines jammed, and lines snaked outside unemployment offices. And many states don‚Äôt have the funds to handle a surge in unemployment claims without assistance from the federal government.\\n\\nCongress already allocated $1 billion in funds to help states ramp up their capacity to dole out unemployment benefits in a bill that passed last week. But experts said there‚Äôs a lot more that could be done to use the unemployment insurance system to get money to people quickly. For instance, only about 27 percent of unemployed Americans actually received benefits in 2016, in part because of the complicated maze of restrictions that people face when they apply. Some states are already starting to remove barriers ‚Äî like waiting periods or some eligibility requirements ‚Äî to ensure that more people qualify. During the last recession, the federal government also pitched in money to help cover the ballooning cost of the state unemployment insurance programs, and it seemed to pay off, according to studies that were conducted later.\\n\\nArindrajit Dube, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, suggested increasing the amount of money that recipients are eligible for, too. Right now, unemployment insurance only replaces between one-third and one-half of a person‚Äôs income. In normal times, Dube said, the payments should be capped around 50 percent of workers‚Äô normal wages ‚Äî if the benefits were more generous, people might not look very hard for another job. The trouble is that right now, we have the opposite problem. ‚ÄúWe want people not to work for health reasons,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo for our purposes in this very specific and unique moment, having a generous payout accomplishes exactly what we want it to.‚Äù\\n\\nPutting more money in Americans‚Äô pockets through stimulus payments could help too, Dube said ‚Äî unless the checks simply can‚Äôt get out to people as quickly as they need them. During the 2008 financial crisis, Congress sent a tax rebate out to many Americans, which is similar to what‚Äôs being proposed now. A study conducted in the wake of the payments found that the rebates did raise consumer spending. But the checks didn‚Äôt actually arrive at people‚Äôs homes until several months after the legislation had passed, which could be a big problem for low-wage workers, who often have minimal savings.\\n\\nThere are other ways to get funds to low-income Americans, Dutta-Gupta told me ‚Äî for example, by putting more money onto the cards that food stamp recipients use to buy groceries. Angela Rachidi, a Rowe scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, meanwhile, favors funneling money to poor families through an emergency version of the earned income tax credit, a subsidy that supplements the earnings of low-income workers when they file their taxes. ‚ÄúThese are the people who are least likely to be able to work from home, and many of them are single parents, which means they may need to take time off work to watch their children,‚Äù Rachidi said. ‚ÄúWe already know they‚Äôre vulnerable ‚Äî why not focus on them first?‚Äù\\n\\nThe problem with more targeted interventions is that, inevitably, they leave some people out. Freelancers and independent contractors working in the ‚Äúgig economy,‚Äù for example, don‚Äôt usually qualify for unemployment insurance. Part-time workers also can‚Äôt get access to unemployment benefits in some states. And there are plenty of people who will be financially harmed by the economic shutdown, but who won‚Äôt necessarily lose a job. ‚ÄúThe economic need is going to be tremendous, and unemployment is only one piece of it,‚Äù said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Century Foundation. ‚ÄúSome people are graduating from college and might have trouble finding work. You might lose overtime or a bonus.‚Äù\\n\\nBut Stettner added that from his perspective, the stimulus checks are only one piece of the puzzle. ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt one single way to shore up people‚Äôs incomes right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to be broad and targeted. On its own, a $1,000 check is not going to solve many people‚Äôs problems right now.‚Äù', 'author': ['Amelia Thomson-Deveaux']}, {'link': 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-is-hitting-restaurants-hard-even-in-states-that-havent-shut-them-down/', 'published': '2020-03-19T18:58:25', 'title': 'Coronavirus Is Hitting Restaurants Hard, Even In States That Haven‚Äôt Shut Them Down', 'text': 'Across the country the number of COVID-19 cases are increasing ‚Äî and the number of restaurant patrons are plummeting.\\n\\nTake Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine was the first governor in the country to shutter bars and restaurants statewide, forcing patrons to dine at home. But even before DeWine‚Äôs March 15 order, restaurants were already feeling the impact of the coronavirus as customers began to avoid crowded areas in their cities.\\n\\nThat chart shows the year-over-year change in seated diners, according to data from OpenTable, an online restaurant reservation platform. OpenTable services almost 60,000 restaurants worldwide, including 35 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., and while its data is not a random sample it does offer a glimpse into what‚Äôs happening in the restaurant industry nationwide. And what‚Äôs happening is not good.\\n\\nMany restaurants are now paralyzed. Governors across the country have issued executive orders restricting or prohibiting seated dining in restaurants ‚Äî 33 states so far, though all of the states are allowing take-away or delivery orders. The majority of these closures have come on the heels of updated guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending people avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people.\\n\\nBut no matter whether the governor has issued an order or not, restaurants in every state available in the OpenTable data set have experienced declining dining attendance over the last two weeks. As public pleas for social distancing get louder, diners are forced to order food for take-away or delivery, or simply to cook at home.\\n\\nDiminishing clientele ‚Äî and the diminishing profits that result ‚Äî make it unsustainable for many restaurants to stay open and maintain fixed costs, let alone continue to pay wages. Some restaurants prepared to close even before the shutdowns took effect, citing consideration for the health and safety of the community.\\n\\nThose that try to stay open have been fighting against a whiplash of regulatory changes. Restaurants in New York City, for example, which were told they had to cut capacity by 50 percent on March 13. Just three days later, they were forced to close their doors to diners altogether. Restaurateur David Chang, owner of the worldwide Momofuku restaurant group, noted the absurdity in drumming up a new, pared-back business model in the midst of a crisis and mocked the idea that pick-up and delivery would be a Band-Aid for forced closures.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs no secret many workers in the food and beverage and service industries live paycheck to paycheck and, as my colleagues pointed out this week, are among the most vulnerable in an economic crisis. And filing for unemployment can be a tedious process, because waiting periods and benefits vary state by state. Many business owners are still struggling to decide whether to furlough, lay off or hold on to employees in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, which only creates more uncertainty for Americans about next steps. Amendments to the current process for filing unemployment (like these in North Carolina or these in New York) will be vital for the wave of workers who have lost their jobs.\\n\\nAs states continue to order restaurant closures, we‚Äôll almost certainly see more abrupt drops in patronship like we saw in Ohio. To soften the economic blow, advocacy and nonprofit groups are calling for relief funds and resources to support laid-off workers and small business owners. But without tax relief or other forms of economic forgiveness from local and federal governments, it‚Äôs unclear how many will once again open their doors.\\n\\nHow Should You Social Distance?', 'author': ['Anna Wiederkehr']}, {'link': 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-workers-are-most-vulnerable-to-the-economic-costs-of-the-coronavirus/', 'published': '2020-03-18T15:53:31', 'title': 'Which Workers Are Most Vulnerable To The Economic Costs Of The Coronavirus?', 'text': 'Kolby Ledbetter, 25, began worrying about the new coronavirus a few weeks ago, when it became clear that it was starting to spread in the United States. He works two jobs ‚Äî a full-time job as an Americorps service member in Chicago and a part-time job at a bar ‚Äî and at first, his main concern was for his health, since he doesn‚Äôt have paid leave at his bar job or health insurance to fall back on.\\n\\nThen on Sunday afternoon, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced that all bars and restaurants would be shut down for dine-in customers through the end of March. The bar where Ledbetter works closed the next day, leaving him with a whole new set of worries. ‚ÄúEven before all of this coronavirus stuff, I had a lot of financial anxiety because I was basically living paycheck to paycheck,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow I have a lot of worry about my health, but I‚Äôm also terrified about my ability to stay afloat financially even if I don‚Äôt get sick.‚Äù\\n\\nAs dramatic measures to tamp down the spread of the virus are implemented across the country, workers like Ledbetter will likely be among the first to feel the economic effects. Big retailers like Gap and Columbia Sportswear are cutting their hours or shutting down entirely in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. And bars and restaurants have also been closed or restricted in a number of states beyond Illinois. On Monday, President Trump urged Americans in a press conference to avoid congregating in groups of more than 10 people.\\n\\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers like Ledbetter could be especially hard hit economically by the coronavirus, as part-time workers, very young or old workers, and workers in the lowest quartile of earnings are disproportionately likely to work in service industry or sales jobs.\\n\\nMartha Ross, a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution who studies the labor market, told us that workers like Ledbetter have few economic protections right now. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of folks who don‚Äôt get paid leave if they get sick. They probably can‚Äôt work remotely, so they‚Äôre more likely to get sick if they do go to work,‚Äù said Ross. ‚ÄúAnd even if they don‚Äôt get the virus, they‚Äôre still at higher risk of losing their jobs or having their hours cut. They‚Äôre vulnerable no matter what happens.‚Äù\\n\\nCrises have a way of exposing inequalities that linger uncomfortably below the surface when times are good. A few groups of workers are particularly likely to lack both paid leave and the ability to work from home: part-time workers, the youngest and oldest people in the workforce (those under the age of 25 and over the age of 65) and workers who fall below the 25th percentile of earnings.\\n\\nWho is economically vulnerable to the coronavirus?

Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, American Time Use Survey\\n\\nOf course, some of these groups make up a bigger portion of the workforce than others. Workers over the age of 65 ‚Äî who are also at elevated risk of a life-threatening infection because of their age ‚Äî only make up about 5 percent of people with jobs, for instance. But part-time workers make up about 20 percent. Some of these groups may overlap ‚Äî young workers, for example, are disproportionately likely to be part-time workers ‚Äî but they still represent a sizable chunk of the country‚Äôs workforce.\\n\\nMany of these workers are employed in jobs that will be hard-hit by the recent wave of closures and cancellations, too. Almost one-third of part-time workers are employed in the service industry, which includes people who work in food preparation, and 25 percent work in sales. About 40 percent of workers under the age of 25 are employed in service or sales, too. Other research suggests that contingent workers ‚Äî independent contractors, freelancers, or other people who work in the ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù ‚Äî are disproportionately likely to be affected, since they‚Äôre more likely to be young and to work part-time. And they typically have no access to paid leave or other benefits because their employment is only temporary. They also tend to make less than workers in traditional, permanent jobs. (The data wasn‚Äôt available from the BLS, but low-wage workers are also overrepresented in these sectors that will be hard hit.)\\n\\nWhere do economically vulnerable employees work?

She has the money to cover her rent for April, but says she doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôll do if the entertainment industry remains shuttered. ‚ÄúI have no idea how to get income.‚Äù\\n\\nAnd Taylor is not alone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bad week to be a waiter, or a cashier, or any kind of contractor whose work relies on in-person interaction,‚Äù said Jesse Rothstein, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ‚ÄúThose people are going to see dramatic cuts to their income ‚Äî their hours might be reduced, or they might lose their jobs altogether.‚Äù\\n\\nTaken together, all of these factors create a bleak outlook, no matter what happens next. People who don‚Äôt have access to paid leave and the ability to work remotely are disproportionately likely to be low-income, which means if their workplace isn‚Äôt shuttered, they‚Äôre more likely to keep coming to work out of necessity, even if they‚Äôre not feeling well. That can put them at greater risk of being infected, since their coworkers may be doing the same thing. Research has found some workers in the food service industry kept coming to work even though they had symptoms of norovirus because they were afraid of losing their job or leaving their coworkers short-staffed.\\n\\nAnd the possibility that many will lose their jobs or have their hours cut because of the coronavirus creates a whole new set of problems. A survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation from March 11 to 15 found that 73 percent of workers with a household income of less than $40,000 a year, 68 percent of part-time workers, and 60 percent of self-employed workers are worried that they will lose income due to a workplace closure or reduced hours because of the coronavirus. According to that survey, part-time and self-employed workers are likelier than full-time or salaried workers to say they‚Äôve already lost income so far.\\n\\nIf the shutdowns persist, some employers may go out of business, leaving workers who weren‚Äôt permanently laid off with no job to return to. ‚ÄúWe have to start thinking about what‚Äôs going to happen when people can‚Äôt pay their rent or mortgage,‚Äù Rothstein said. ‚ÄúBecause these workers are going to start burning through their savings ‚Äî if they have any at all.‚Äù\\n\\nCORRECTION (March 18, 2020, 4:26 p.m.): A previous version of this article gave an incorrect number for the share of part-time workers.

Let‚Äôs just say it doesn‚Äôt take a crack journalistic mind to suspect something odd was happening.\\n\\nSo this journalistic mind responded to all the ads. What I found was a story that went beyond mattresses in Minneapolis. More Americans are buying more stuff online, a trend driven partly by free and easy return policies. But as retailers sell more, they also end up with more items being sent back ‚Äî creating a long, winding logistical trail that can very easily end up at the city dump.\\n\\nThe problem only gets more complicated when the thing being sold is a large, awkward block of heavy foam. Many, many online bed-in-a-box retailers have sprung up in recent years. The first of these companies popped up around 2010. Today, there are dozens of them, and as mattress-in-a-box companies proliferate like so many bedbugs, they‚Äôre finding themselves with a waste problem.\\n\\nPart of what has made these companies successful is their return policies, said J. Andrew Petersen, a professor of marketing at Penn State University. In the early 2000s, his research demonstrated that returns weren‚Äôt necessarily bad for business. His work tracked sales data for a catalog clothing company over six years and found that as customers returned more items, they also purchased more ‚Äî even as they also were receiving fewer of the company‚Äôs catalogs in the mail because of their return habits. There are limits to this, he told me, but in his studies, return rates as high as 13 percent were actually associated with higher profits.\\n\\nThese findings coincided with an easy-return era in online sales. That‚Äôs driven a massive growth in both direct-to-consumer sales and returns, said Paula Rosenblum, managing partner of Retail Systems Research, a market analysis firm. Between 2010 and 2015, returns across the U.S. and Canada increased by 66 percent, according to the U.S. Postal Service. But while shopping got more convenient, ‚Äúreturned‚Äù hasn‚Äôt always meant ‚Äúresold.‚Äù When items come back to a retailer, they have to be sorted and repackaged, which costs money, and retailers might not be able to resell them at full price. ‚ÄúHow much are you willing to pay for margins so slim?‚Äù Petersen said. The result: As much as 5 billion pounds of stuff just thrown out every year.\\n\\nWhich brings us back to my mattress adventure. Most mattress-in-a-box companies have offered free, simple returns during a long ‚Äútry it out‚Äù period. If you don‚Äôt like the bed, you can return it and get your money back. Seems easy, so I tried it.\\n\\nI had bought a mattress from a company called Tulo, but wanted to swap a medium-firmness model for a firm one. Which is how I found that, at least for this company, ‚Äúreturning‚Äù the unwanted mattress really just meant something more along the lines of ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd prefer you donate it, but do what you want with it.‚Äù And this is the problem with lenient return policies for mattresses that arrive at customers‚Äô house vacuum packed into a narrow tube. You can‚Äôt stuff this particular genie back into the bottle.\\n\\nI ended up on Craigslist looking at mattresses because I wanted to know if I could resell mine. The four ads I found ‚Äî for Purple brand mattresses at half their retail price ‚Äî told me resale was possible. But something weird was going on.\\n\\nAt the other end of those eerily identical ads I found a single seller ‚Äî an independent agent for a new kind of company that‚Äôs aiming to solve the mattress companies‚Äô problems and reduce landfill waste. Called Sharetown, it works kind of like Uber and Lyft: A mattress company contracts with Sharetown to handle returns and, when one pops up, Sharetown connects the customer with an nearby agent who takes the mattress off their hands, cleans it up, and markets it for sale on local community sites like Facebook and Craigslist. When the mattress sells, everybody gets a cut ‚Äî the agent, Sharetown and the company that originally sold the mattress.\\n\\nCody Hunter, founder and CEO of Sharetown, said it doesn‚Äôt compete with new sales because generally the people buying a used mattress aren‚Äôt the people who are willing to pay full price. He sees it more like allowing the company to reach customers they‚Äôd otherwise never be able to get. Sharetown has partnerships with multiple mattress companies, including Purple, Layla, Nest, Helix, Luma and Nature‚Äôs Sleep.\\n\\nWhile clothing returns have driven growth in a secondhand industry that‚Äôs now big enough to be releasing market reports, mattresses have presented more complex logistics. The brands that work with Sharetown aren‚Äôt the only ones who‚Äôve had to think outside the box. To make sure its unwanted mattresses go to charity, Tuft & Needle has developed an in-house logistics system and partners with a network of over 250 partner charities, said Melanie LaDue, the company‚Äôs giveback lead. When a customer wants to return a mattress, Tuft & Needle sets them up with one of those partners and only processes the refund after the customer uploads a picture of their donation receipt.\\n\\nIdeally, this system runs smoothly, with mattresses being picked up for free and taken to people in need. But that‚Äôs not always the case, LaDue told me. ‚ÄúIn California, a lot of charities can‚Äôt accept a used mattress,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúNew York is another tricky area because charities aren‚Äôt willing or able to go into the city for pickup.‚Äù In those situations, all the company can do is encourage customers to donate to friends and family or, if all else fails, spend some of its own money to hire a waste removal company ‚Äî which may mean at least part of the mattress will go to a landfill.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs not business as usual for retail sales companies to contract out to secondhand dealers or build a charity logistics arm, but avoiding the landfill takes more than just good intentions.\\n\\nCORRECTION (Feb. 20, 2020, 11:40 a.m.): A previous version of this article inaccurately said that the online mattress sales were a $29 billion industry. That is a 2017 valuation of the entire mattress industry, not just the online sector. Online sales are now about 14 percent of the total domestic mattress market. Also, this article said online sales were worth 20 times as much in 2019 as they had been in 2014. That was an estimate of sales for six companies, not an industrywide measure.

In a survey released earlier this week by the National Association of Business Economics, 38 percent of economists predicted that the country will slip into an economic downturn next year, and another recent poll of economists put the chances of a recession in the next 12 months at 1 in 3. Those predictions are getting a lot of attention, and it‚Äôs not hard to see why ‚Äî an economic slowdown in the middle of the presidential election cycle could reshape the race, potentially changing the calculus of Democratic primary voters and undermining President Trump, who has made the strong economy a central selling point of his presidency.\\n\\nBut take a deep breath before you spend a lot of time trying to figure out how a recession would change Trump‚Äôs reelection chances: Although the economy does have a big effect on an incumbent president‚Äôs odds of winning a second term, economists have a terrible track record when it comes to predicting recessions.\\n\\n‚ÄúVery, very few recessions have been predicted nine months or a year in advance,‚Äù Prakash Loungani, an economist at the International Monetary Fund, told me.\\n\\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean a recession won‚Äôt strike in the near future. Over the past few weeks and months, there have been some worrisome signals about the country‚Äôs economic health, fueling broader concerns about an impending recession. But exactly when the next economic downturn will come ‚Äî and specifically whether it will interrupt the 2020 election cycle ‚Äî is extremely uncertain. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no economic data or research or analysis that suggests we can look 12 months into the future and predict recessions with any confidence,‚Äù said Tara Sinclair, a professor of economics at George Washington University.\\n\\nInstead, and despite the recent rash of stories about economists‚Äô predictions, economic downturns usually come as a surprise. A 2018 study conducted by Loungani and others looked at 153 recessions in 63 countries between 1992 and 2014 and found that the vast majority were missed by economists in both the public and private sector. This was painfully true in the case of the global financial crisis in 2008, which wasn‚Äôt officially declared a recession until it had been going for almost a year. Other studies have found that in general, forecasters are too sunny about economic growth.\\n\\nPart of the problem, according to Loungani, was that in the past, economists were unwilling to risk their reputations by predicting an imminent recession that never came to pass. So it might actually be a good thing, he said, if more economists were now willing to sound the alarm. But Sinclair noted that even now, relatively few are pointing to an immediate crisis. In one of the polls, for instance, the share of economists who said they were expecting a recession this year fell from 10 percent in February to 2 percent in July.\\n\\nAnd even if economists are more willing to be wrong these days than they were a decade ago, the task of predicting recessions itself hasn‚Äôt become easier. We have plenty of clues about how the economy is doing, but a system that‚Äôs so big, complex and deeply intertwined with human psychology and actions will always be difficult to predict.\\n\\nRecently, for instance, the financial world flew into a tizzy over the inverted yield curve, which is generally seen as a reliable harbinger of an economic downturn. An inverted yield curve appears when short-term investments pay more than long-term ones, and it generally reflects a pessimistic mood among investors about the economy‚Äôs future performance. When the yield curve stays inverted for three months ‚Äî as it did earlier this year ‚Äî that‚Äôs a clear sign that a recession could be coming, according to research by Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University. But it‚Äôs not a guarantee, since an inverted yield curve doesn‚Äôt itself cause a recession. Instead, it‚Äôs a reflection of how investors feel about the economy‚Äôs future ‚Äî and those feelings could be off-base. Other economists, like Sinclair, also said they‚Äôre not sure yet what the inverted yield curve means ‚Äî and Harvey added that although it has a good predictive track record, it‚Äôs just one signal in a complex economic landscape.\\n\\nEven if the inverted yield curve proves prescient and a downturn does come, we don‚Äôt have a good way to pinpoint when it will hit. According to Harvey, recessions have followed inverted yield curves by anywhere between six and 22 months. That‚Äôs not a small range, especially in political terms ‚Äî it‚Äôs the difference between an economic slowdown that begins just before the Iowa caucuses and a recession that starts five months after the next presidential inauguration.\\n\\nAnd in the meantime, consumers, investors and policymakers will all keep doing things that affect the economy. It‚Äôs possible that the anxious headlines about an impending recession could become self-fulfilling if everyday people respond by saving their money instead of spending it. Or maybe the opposite will happen, and smart policy responses to early warning signals could ward off a recession or make it less damaging.\\n\\nEither way, the unpredictability of human behavior will frustrate anyone trying to pin down exactly when a recession will arrive. That doesn‚Äôt mean economists should stop making forecasts or that signals like the inverted yield curve aren‚Äôt useful. But anyone looking at predictions about when the next recession will land should take those forecasts with a big grain of salt. ‚ÄúGiven historical patterns, a recession is likely to come again, so we need to be talking about what we‚Äôre going to do when it hits,‚Äù Sinclair said. ‚ÄúBut we have to be open about the fact that we don‚Äôt really know when that will be.‚Äù', 'author': ['Amelia Thomson-Deveaux']}, {'link': 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-hiring-a-visual-journalist-to-cover-sports-the-2020-election-and-more/', 'published': '2019-06-25T17:32:01', 'title': 'We‚Äôre Hiring A Visual Journalist To Cover Sports, The 2020 Election And More', 'text': 'We‚Äôre Hiring A Visual Journalist To Cover Sports, The 2020 Election And More\\n\\nFiveThirtyEight‚Äôs graphics and interactives team is growing!

Hansen is accused of receiving at least $800,000 from Chinese sources in exchange for information he learned from ‚Äúmilitary and intelligence conferences in the U.S.‚Äù and for sensitive technology that the U.S. government had banned from being shared with China.\\n\\nHansen is the fourth former intelligence officer ‚Äî along with Jerry Chun Shing Lee, Joshua Schulte and Kevin Mallory ‚Äî arrested for espionage or attempted espionage in just the last year. But one part of his story sets him apart: Hansen‚Äôs payoff ‚Äî at least $800,000 ‚Äî is more than the vast majority of people arrested for spying over the past few decades were paid.\\n\\nOf course, we‚Äôre talking about spying here, so there‚Äôs only so much we know about these cases ‚Äî even the spies who get caught are pretty good at keeping secrets, and the people who catch them are even better. But we can get at least a rough overview of how much spies get paid using two sources: the Defense Personnel Security Research Center‚Äôs research into espionage from 1975 to 2008, and its report from last year updating the data to 2015. For cases since 2015, we can use Justice Department press releases.\\n\\nThe data is incomplete, of course ‚Äî it can‚Äôt tell us anything about any spies who weren‚Äôt caught or whose payout information was never made public ‚Äî but all told, I identified more than 100 people who were arrested for spying or similar offenses since 1975 and for whom we can estimate how much they were paid. I then adjusted those income estimates to 2018 dollars, using the year the person was arrested to approximate the year that the payoff was made. It‚Äôs an imperfect method, especially for someone like former FBI Special Agent Robert Hanssen, who was arrested in 2001 but likely earned most of his money between 1985 and 1991. But people committing espionage tend not to keep meticulous details of their illicit income, so payment details are, for the most part, best guesses made from the publicly available data.\\n\\nIn any case (caveats aside), what does the data show? There was very little financial gain for the vast majority of people arrested for spying in the cases for which we have payoff data. Most people in our data set didn‚Äôt sell secrets so much as give them away: 56 percent got no known compensation for their actions. Another 9 percent were paid less than $12,000, not even enough for the average used car.\\n\\nSome people ‚Äî such as Cuban spy Ana Montes ‚Äî spied for ideological reasons and may have refused payment out of principle. Most of those who weren‚Äôt paid, though, were intercepted before they could do real damage ‚Äî such as Brian Regan, an officer from the National Reconnaissance Office who intended to sell secrets to China, Iraq and Libya for $13 million but was arrested before he could carry out his plan.\\n\\nOnly four U.S. spies are thought to have been paid at least $1 million over their careers: CIA officers Aldrich Ames and Larry Wu-Tai Chin, Army officer Clyde Conrad and Navy officer John Walker. So Hansen‚Äôs alleged haul of $800,000 would place him near the top of the list in terms of income derived from passing secrets.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, most people arrested for espionage or similar crimes receive lengthy prison sentences regardless of whether they‚Äôve earned lots of money ‚Äî which they usually haven‚Äôt. Ames, Conrad, Hanssen and Walker all received life sentences, while Wu-Tai Chin died by suicide prior to sentencing. Regan and National Guardsman Ryan Anderson similarly received life sentences for unsuccessfully trying to pass secrets to Iraq and Libya (Regan) and al-Qaida (Anderson). In terms of its risk-reward calculation, espionage doesn‚Äôt seem like a good bet:\\n\\nOf course, there are a few limitations to looking at spy data like this.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, we can only analyze the spies we know about. There are undoubtedly many former and active spies out there that we may not know about for decades ‚Äî if at all. The National Security Agency, for example, lists the code names of several assets discovered through VENONA ‚Äî a Cold War project that aimed to decrypt Soviet cables sent in the 1940s ‚Äî as either unidentified or having been identified only decades after their spying ended. One such asset was a woman code named ‚ÄúTina‚Äù who the Soviets claimed in 1945 had made a ‚Äúvaluable contribution‚Äù to their efforts to steal the atom bomb, and it wasn‚Äôt until 1992 that British authorities learned she had been a secretary named Melita Norwood.\\n\\nAnother challenge is that it‚Äôs impossible to calculate any payments received by the handful of intelligence professionals who defected from the U.S. over the years. Edward Lee Howard evaded FBI surveillance in 1985 and made it to the Soviet Union after being fired from the CIA. Air Force officer Jeffrey Carney defected to East Germany in 1985, and NSA officers William Martin and Bernon Mitchell fled to Moscow in 1960. There‚Äôs no way of accurately gauging how much money or valuables those defectors may have received from their new host countries.\\n\\nFinally, people who committed espionage on behalf of the U.S. may have made as much or more than even the $2.5 million (over $4 million in 2018 dollars) that Ames was allegedly paid by Russia. One former KGB officer was allegedly paid at least $7 million for a file with Hanssen‚Äôs fingerprints and a voice recording of him talking with the KGB, according to a book by David Wise.\\n\\nAnd then there‚Äôs the case of ‚ÄúAsset X,‚Äù who led the CIA to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, according to a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report released in 2014. The information that Asset X gave the U.S. government would have qualified him to claim much or all of the $25 million reward for Mohammed‚Äôs capture, and indeed Asset X‚Äôs case officer used the reward to motivate the asset to find Mohammed.\\n\\nBut Asset X is more the exception than the rule. Mallory, one of the four U.S. intelligence officers arrested in the last year, was found guilty in early June on charges including selling secrets to China for $25,000. During his trial, Mallory‚Äôs attorney argued that, ‚ÄúNo one sells national defense information for $25,000. That is pocket change.‚Äù\\n\\nAs the evidence shows, however, many people have traded classified information for little more than pocket lint.\\n\\nNote: Jeff Asher is a former CIA analyst.', 'author': ['Jeff Asher']}, {'link': 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-tariffs-cost-trump-the-farm-vote/', 'published': '2018-04-26T10:01:40', 'title': 'What If Tariffs Cost Trump The Farm Vote?', 'text': 'In 1977, Jimmy Carter made an improbable journey from Georgia peanut grower to Democratic president in part by playing on his humble roots and receiving support from America‚Äôs farmers. Yet this bedrock voting constituency abandoned a fellow farmer to back Ronald Reagan four years later, after Carter punished Moscow for invading Afghanistan by cutting off grain sales to the Soviet Union. U.S. farmers were already struggling with collapsing crop prices, and the embargo may have been the final straw. Farmers threw their support behind Reagan, who had promised to lift the hated restrictions.\\n\\nThis might seem like ancient history, but it‚Äôs still relevant to ‚Äî and well-remembered in ‚Äî today‚Äôs Farm Belt, where farmers are once again torn between devotion to a president and anger at the tariff policies he‚Äôs imposed that are set to wreak havoc on agricultural prices. Although farmers overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump in 2016, discontent over tariffs and trade policy could induce farmers to oppose his bid for re-election ‚Äî and their strategic location might just enable them to thwart it.\\n\\nFirst, Trump did really well in the states that have more farmers:\\n\\nIn particular, there are three states that Trump won by narrow margins in which a mass farmer defection could prove pivotal: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In each of these states, the number of farmers far exceeds the president‚Äôs margin of victory in 2016. If all three states saw significant ag defection, a Democratic challenger could pick up a total of 46 Electoral College votes ‚Äî enough to tip the balance even if Trump performs up to his 2016 standards in every other state in the union.\\n\\nWhere farmers could make a difference Number of farm operators and Trump‚Äôs vote margin, for states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election state Trump Vote Margin No. farm operators Difference Michigan +10.7k 80.3k -69.6k ‚Äì Wisconsin +22.7 111.1 -88.3 ‚Äì Pennsylvania +44.3 92.3 -48.0 ‚Äì Alaska +46.9 1.2 +45.7 ‚Äì Arizona +91.2 33.6 +57.6 ‚Äì Montana +101.5 45.2 +56.3 ‚Äì South Dakota +110.3 49.0 +61.3 ‚Äì Florida +112.9 74.5 +38.4 ‚Äì Wyoming +118.4 19.7 +98.8 ‚Äì North Dakota +123.0 45.0 +78.0 ‚Äì Iowa +147.3 131.5 +15.8 ‚Äì North Carolina +173.3 73.8 +99.5 ‚Äì Utah +204.6 28.8 +175.7 ‚Äì Georgia +211.1 61.9 +149.3 ‚Äì Nebraska +211.5 75.9 +135.6 ‚Äì Mississippi +215.6 55.6 +160.0 ‚Äì Idaho +219.3 40.6 +178.7 ‚Äì Kansas +244.0 92.9 +151.1 ‚Äì South Carolina +300.0 37.1 +263.0 ‚Äì West Virginia +300.6 32.2 +268.4 ‚Äì Arkansas +304.4 69.7 +234.7 ‚Äì Louisiana +398.5 41.6 +356.9 ‚Äì Ohio +446.8 115.7 +331.1 ‚Äì Missouri +523.4 152.8 +370.6 ‚Äì Indiana +524.2 89.8 +434.3 ‚Äì Oklahoma +528.8 121.6 +407.2 ‚Äì Kentucky +574.1 114.2 +459.9 ‚Äì Alabama +588.7 64.1 +524.7 ‚Äì Tennessee +652.2 101.6 +550.6 ‚Äì Texas +807.2 375.9 +431.3 ‚Äì Sources: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, U.S. Census Bureau, DAVE LEIP‚ÄôS ATLAS OF U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS\\n\\nOf course, 2020 is unlikely to be an exact replay of 2016. But these swing states in the Midwest are a good bet to be competitive again, making any erosion of Trump‚Äôs support among farmers a big worry for the president.\\n\\nSo what‚Äôs getting in between Trump and farmers?\\n\\nTrump raised farmers‚Äô alarm bells when he bandied about the idea of pulling out of NAFTA and cutting off free trade with Canada, one of the biggest importers of U.S. agricultural products. As farmers‚Äô groups bought pricey airtime to run ads that attempted to dissuade policymakers from exiting the North American trade deal, a more immediate threat to the farm economy appeared on the horizon this month: In reaction to protectionist manufacturing tariffs leveled by the U.S., China ‚Äî another big destination for U.S. agricultural products ‚Äî retaliated, placing 15 percent tariffs on numerous agricultural exports and a 25 percent markup on pork products.\\n\\nWhen Trump responded by announcing plans for $100 billion in additional tariffs, China threatened more of its own, including one on the U.S.‚Äôs top agricultural export, soybeans.\\n\\nIn a recent Senate Finance Committee meeting on Trump‚Äôs tariffs, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley said that farmers in his state ‚Äústill remember President Carter‚Äôs grain embargo.‚Äù Grassley reached the Senate in those same 1980 elections. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs 38 years ago, but that‚Äôs still in the memory of farmers,‚Äù he said.\\n\\nIndeed, the Iowa senator knows his audience. The average age of U.S. farmers has been increasing over the past several decades, rising from 51 in 1982 to 58 in 2012 ‚Äî the most recent year for which data is available. The average age is now likely to be close to 60 years old, which means that the bulk of U.S. farmers were old enough to vote when they abandoned Carter as a group in 1980.\\n\\nData on how farmers voted at that time is elusive, but anecdotal evidence suggests that the share of farmers who backed Reagan was high. A member of Reagan‚Äôs agricultural transition team put the number at ‚Äúat least two-thirds,‚Äù and The Washington Post described the farm sector as ‚Äúone of the most solid blocs for Reagan.‚Äù The New York Times concluded that ‚Äúmany farmers who had voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976 supported Mr. Reagan‚Äù in 1980 ‚Äúbecause they felt Mr. Carter had broken a campaign pledge never to establish an embargo on agricultural products except in a case of extreme national emergency.‚Äù\\n\\nFlash forward to 2016, when 67 percent of farmers voted for Trump. Farmers were no doubt drawn to his deregulatory message and motivated by their perception that any Obama-era economic recovery had left them behind. In all regions, farmers are overwhelmingly Republican voters, regardless of the size of the operation.\\n\\nBut after months of controversy over farm labor visas, falling commodity prices and withdrawal from free-trade agreements, a recent survey conducted by Agri-Pulse, one of America‚Äôs leading agricultural news sources, adds weight to Grassley‚Äôs warning. The survey ‚Äî conducted from Feb. 26 through March 9, before the most recent tariff battles ‚Äî indicates that farmers are losing patience with the president. Although 67 percent said they had voted for Trump, only 45 percent said they would support his re-election.\\n\\nThere are fewer farmers today than there were in 1980. The number has shrunk by about 15 percent ‚Äî from the approximately 2.4 million farms dotting the U.S. countryside to about 2 million today. Farmers now represent around 1 percent of the U.S. population. But the geographic distribution of these farmers, as well as their voting habits, could turn them into a powerful anti-Trump force ready to pop up in 2020 and alter the balance of the elections.\\n\\nThese Midwestern states are typically extremely close in presidential elections. They certainly were in 2016. And Trump would be more vulnerable there in 2020 if farmers abandoned him. Farmers are good voters in general, and in 2016, an estimated 74 percent of them turned out to vote in competitive states in the presidential elections. In Michigan, Trump won by 10,704 votes, and there are approximately 80,000 farmers in the state. And somewhere around 67 percent of them (let‚Äôs call it 40,000) voted for Trump if they were consistent with national projections. All it would take is for slightly a little more than one in four of those farmers to jump ship to turn the tables against Trump. The numbers are similar in Wisconsin. (Trump won Pennsylvania by a bit more.)\\n\\nWe can use the Agri-Pulse poll to look at this in a slightly different way. If only 45 percent of Michigan farmers vote for Trump, he would get 27,000 farm votes ‚Äî a loss of 13,100. Without any other change, Trump just lost Michigan and has been reduced to a razor-thin margin of victory Wisconsin. If 45 percent of Wisconsin farmers voted for Trump, he‚Äôd get about 37,000 farm votes, a loss that would reduce his lead to around 5,000.\\n\\nElections, of course, don‚Äôt work this way ‚Äî one group moving while all others vote the same way ‚Äî but the math shows that there are enough farmers in these crucial states to make a difference should they fully sour on Trump.\\n\\nOne thing we can be sure of is that these Chinese tariffs will have a negative impact on the agricultural sector in all three states. The first round of tariffs included two of Michigan‚Äôs top agricultural products ‚Äî hogs and apples ‚Äî and two of Wisconsin‚Äôs ‚Äî hogs and cranberries. Also, soy is the third-largest agricultural product for both states. They both also count corn among their top 10 products; while the first round of tariffs imposed a 15 percent duty on ethanol, a key application for the U.S. corn crop, the second round of threatened tariffs included corn as well. While corn is a major export product for U.S. farmers, the Chinese market represents a very small market share for edible corn.\\n\\nFarmers may not be the massive voting bloc they once were, but as Jimmy Carter learned nearly four decades ago, presidents ignore farmers‚Äô needs ‚Äî and erode farmers‚Äô markets ‚Äî at great peril.', 'author': ['Rebecca Shimoni Stoil']}]}, 'nbpostgazette': {'rss': 'http://nbpostgazette.com/feed/', 'link': 'http://http://nbpostgazette.com/', 'articles': [{'link': 'https://nbpostgazette.com/zoom-video-conferencing-tip/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=zoom-video-conferencing-tip', 'published': '2020-03-28T15:07:01', 'title': 'Top 5 Zoom Tips To Follow On Next Video Meeting Or Chatting', 'text': 'The global pandemic has forced all the companies across the world to encourage work from home culture.

Hence, zoom allows you to change the background virtually. The users can go to the setting and simply choose the background of your choice. It is a great option because you can choose a custom background.\\n\\n2. Share screen\\n\\nIf you are planning to give a presentation on video conferencing, you can start sharing your screen with the people on the call. All you need to do is click on the share screen option. The application will start recording your screen and show it to all other connected people. Moreover, users have the option to either share the entire screen or just a specific application like MS PPT. Users also get the option to pause the screen recording in order to reduce the awkwardness while switching between applications.\\n\\n3. Share Screen Simultaneously\\n\\nAnother great feature on the Zoom video conferencing app is that you can share multiple screens. So if you have more than one person displaying a PowerPoint presentation for comparing two documents, this option plays a vital role. All you need to do is make sure that the host has allowed sharing multiple screen recording on the call. It is one of the best ways to clarify multiple points at a time.\\n\\n4. Record your meetings\\n\\nZoom also allows the users to record the entire meeting or some specific part of it. This is a great option to keep a future reference for the meeting and remember what all were discussed during the meeting. Moreover, it is a great feature for those people who are having online classes over zoom. Hence, students can record the entire lecture and keep it for their future reference. The recording is saved on the PC locally.\\n\\n5. Enable Gallery View\\n\\nThe application allows you to connect with more than 20 people in a single video conference. It is not possible to view every single screen individually. By default, the screen keeps rotating and the live camera of each participant is displayed. However, it is not a convenient option if multiple people are connected and they are trying to explain the points simultaneously. Hence, you can click on the gallery view icon at the right-hand top side of the screen to watch all the screens simultaneously.', 'author': ['Prabhat Singh', 'About The Author', 'Prabhat Is A Consistent', 'Hard Working Content Writer With Specialization In Tech', 'Finance Niche.

Understand The Types Available', 'text': 'A personal loan is one of the fastest-growing consumer debts. Most people take a personal loan in order to meet immediate cash requirements for some reason. It is a very good option if the particular person has a good knowledge of restructuring his finances using a personal loan. So are you one of those people who are looking to taking a personal loan anytime soon? There are different types of personal credits available in the financial market and it is very important for an individual to know the type of loan he should opt for. This is why we are going to explain different types of personal loans.\\n\\nTypes of Personal Loan\\n\\n1. Unsecured Loan\\n\\nThis is a type of personal loan which does not require any kind of collateral. Hence, the land is ready to take the entire risk and of a sum of money to the borrower. However, this happens only if the borrower has a very good credit score. The borrower can take the loan and payback in monthly installments. A person can borrow anything between $1000 and $50,000 depending on his credit history. It is a great option if you are having a good credit score. The payback period is usually around 6 years or lower.\\n\\n2. Secured Loans\\n\\nThese loans are given only if the borrower offers collateral. This means that the borrower will have to place collateral like his car or any other asset. Hence, the lender can recover the money in case the borrower defaults. This is a great option if you do not have a great credit history. Moreover, the interest rate is also very low in secured loans because the risk is comparatively lower for the lender.\\n\\n3. Co-signed Loan\\n\\nThis loan is secured or unsecured. But it involves a third person as well. This type of loan is especially for those people who do not have a credit history. Hence, the third person becomes a guarantor. The guarantor can be any relative of the borrower and he pledges to repay the loan in case the borrower defaults.\\n\\n4. Debt Consolidation Loan\\n\\na debt consolidation loan is a great option for those people who are you looking to restructure their finances. It is an option to manage all the loans in a single installment. Hence, the borrower can pay off their payday loans or any other loan taken from the family or friends and get them consolidated into one monthly installment. However, there are many pitfalls and it is suitable only for those people who are disciplined about their finances.\\n\\n5. Personal Line Of Credit\\n\\nA personal line of credit is a great form of personal loan which is very similar to the credit cards. It is very different from the other categories of personal loans. The borrower has a line of credit depending upon his credit score. This means that there is no need for monthly installment to the lender. Rather, users can borrow any amount of money and pay the interest only on the amount which is above the line of credit.', 'author': ['Prabhat Singh', 'About The Author', 'Prabhat Is A Consistent', 'Hard Working Content Writer With Specialization In Tech', 'Finance Niche.

It is because a gaming laptop can be carried from one place to another, unlike a gaming pc. Asus ROG lineup is something you cannot afford to ignore if you are searching for a gaming laptop. The company makes affordable as well as high-performance gaming laptops. ROG Strix G G731GT is a combination of affordable and best-performing laptops.\\n\\nAsus ROG Strix G G731GT is the most affordable laptop in the ROG range. It also managers to keep up to the expectation when it comes to design and performance. We going to give you a detailed review of this gaming laptop.\\n\\nAsus ROG Strix G G731GT Review\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nThe laptop inherits the design of the premium Strix Scar 3. Moreover, it has the same rigged design as other ROG series laptop. The laptop has a metal-plastic chassis. Moreover, there is RGB lighting on the borders. It has been designed by the BMW design studio and this is the reason why it looks elegant. However, the only disappointing thing about the design is that the logo of ROG doesn‚Äôt sign. Being a typical gaming laptop, the device is thick and heavy. It is mainly because it accommodates all the essential ports required for gaming.\\n\\nDisplay\\n\\nThe display is one of the areas where Asus ROG Strix G G731GT lacks. On paper, the laptop is equipped with a full HD IPS LCD screen. However, it is not as good as the other ROG laptops. The images produced on the laptop are sharp but lacks vibrant colors. Even the movie and games appeared dull compared to other laptops in this price range. This is something that you good not expect from a game on the laptop. However, we believe that it is more than sufficient for casual gaming.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe performance of the laptop mainly depends upon the variant you are opting for. The base model of Asus ROG Strix G comes with an Intel i5 processor and a lower variant of Nvidia graphics card. The higher variant comes with the Intel i7 processor and Nvidia graphics 1650, along with 16GB RAM. The game loading speed is much faster on the higher variant because of the SSD. The lower variant has HDD which makes them slower comparatively. However, the laptop won‚Äôt disappoint you in terms of performance. This is because all the ROG series laptops are high performing.\\n\\nSpeakers\\n\\nThe affordable Asus ROG Strix G G731GT does not come with exceptional speakers. It is quite basic and sufficient for YouTube and other online streaming applications. However, it is not at par when will look at it from the gaming point of view. Hence, users must not expect very high-quality audio while gaming.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nOverall, Asus ROG Strix G lives up to the expectation. The performance is quite good and even the design will not fail to impress you. However, display and speaker are of sub-quality. But it is acceptable given the fact that it falls in the affordable gaming laptop category. Hence, you can choose this ROG series gaming laptop.', 'author': ['Prabhat Singh', 'About The Author', 'Prabhat Is A Consistent', 'Hard Working Content Writer With Specialization In Tech', 'Finance Niche.

The game allows the users to come close to nature and use the ultimate resources on the island in order to create anything they want to. It allows creativity to a great extent and users can shape anything like a tool or other things using the natural resources. The game is really amazing and brings everyone closer to creativity and nature. However, the sad part is that it is not available on PC. Hence, we found out the best animal crossing alternatives that you can try out.\\n\\nTop 5 Animal Crossing Alternatives\\n\\n1. Stardew Valley\\n\\nThe game is very similar to an animal cross because the theme is somewhat similar. Both the game brings the player close to nature and does not focus much on creativity but on making the farm more productive and highly profitable. However, one thing is common between the two games. Animal Crossing allows you to customize and decorate even your neighbor‚Äôs farm unlike stardew Valley, where you can just customize your own farm.\\n\\n2. My Time At Portia\\n\\nMy time at Portia is much similar to the animal crossing and Stardew Valley. The only difference between the games is that you inherit a tool shop instead of a farm from your father. But the motive remains the same. The player can make different kinds of tools and help the fellow people of Portia. It is more of an RPG game because you have to encounter monsters and take care of the farms and also beautify your workshop. However, the game is extremely fun to play.\\n\\n3.

Launch was performed from SLC-41 at Cape Canaveral eighteen minutes before midnight.\\n\\nThis could be good sum up of present position of ULA on the market ‚Äì maybe SpaceX got CRS-1 and CRS-2, but still United Launch Alliance is very reliable partner with legendary Atlas V heavy rocket, necessary for delivering to space heavy satellites with GEO as designated orbit. This time again Atlas V rocket long for 62m and powered by Russian RD-180 engines showed that reliability and performance are expensive, but this confidence is worth every dime. Estimated cost of Atlas V, which is at least $100 million in 541 configuration (what is in fact far beyond prices offered by SpaceX for launch service providers outside the USA) is nothing comparing to value of two GOES-R spacecrafts, which is $1.09 billion. In such case reliability is key and most important argument for choice of business partner.\\n\\nLaunch was planned with Atlas V in 541 configuration, what means that GOES-R satellite was covered with payload fairing with diameter of 5 m. Core stage with length of 32.46 m and with diameter at 3.81 was powered by RD-180 engine (fueled with RP-1/LOX) and able to provide thrust at 3827 kN. It was supported by four SRB boosters solid fueled with HTPB, long for 17 m and with diameter at 1.6 m. Each booster can generate 1688.4 kN of thrust. Last digit ‚Äú1‚Äù is determining number of engines in Centaur upper stage. In this case 12 m long and wide for 3.05 m Centaur was powered with single RL-10A engine (fueled with LH2/LOX) and generating thrust at 99.2 kN.\\n\\nLaunch was originally planned for 22:42 UTC and due the favorable weather it seemed possible to keep the schedule. Rocket was waiting at SLC-41 since reaching launch pad after roll out from Vertical Integration Building on Friday afternoon. On Saturday at 15:52 UTC countdown procedure was started. Unfortunately, in different rocket ULA engineers spotted minor problem and it was necessary to perform additional tests and evaluate if unit planned to be used for GOES-R is also affected with issue. Luckily, bad news were not confirmed and it was possible to resume mission and launch Atlas V just in the end of planned launch window. Punctually at 23:42 UTC, rocket ignited core engine and its four boosters. Just after lift off rocket set its designated course at SE and at T+36‚Ä≥ it passed 1 Ma speed. It reached and passed fluently point of maximum dynamic pressure 13 seconds later. All four boosters separated correctly at T+1‚Äô34‚Äù and after another two minutes GOES-R was exposed after jettisoning payload fairing. One minute after losing payload fairing at around T+4‚Äô20‚Äù, RD-180 engine was cut off and separated from Centaur. Upper stage started its RL-10A engine and began to move satellite into GTO orbit. It was done in three burns. First lasted for 450 seconds and was followed by second burn, which lasted for 250 seconds and was initiated at T+22‚Ä≤. Next Centaur reached highly elliptical orbit with apogee at 32717 km, perigee at 187 km and inclination at 25.7¬∞. For the third burn we were forced to wait three hours ‚Äì at T+3h 27‚Ä≤ RL-10A was started for the last time and helped Centaur to raise perigee of the orbit for 8000 km in 93 seconds. At T+3h 32‚Ä≤ satellite was deployed on GTO orbit 8137 km x 35290 km inclined at 10.62¬∞. Telemetry data and first self test report confirmed good health of the satellite and on Monday it will start orbit raising on following days. At day 8 of the mission, after five burns of its LEROS-1C Apogee Kick Motor, satellite should reach designated 105¬∞W orbital slot.\\n\\nGOES-R is weather satellite designed and built by Lockheed Martin for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. With dimensions of 6.1 m x 5.6 m x 3.9 m it weighs 5192 kg (wet) and was based on A2100A modular bus. It is powered with single deployable solar array, which along with onboard batteries, is able to provide power for at least 15 years of planned operational life. It was equipped with Attitude Control System based on reaction wheels and system of thrusters, S band, L band and UHF transponders and data transmitting system able to downlink data with speed of 100 Mbps.

But Sierra Nevada is not going to rest on laurels and is still continuing campaign for acquiring as many landing and launch sites as possible to hit the market with Dream Chaser.\\n\\nIt is another sign confirming how seriously Sierra Nevada Corporation engaged into Dream Chaser. Initiative for the certification of civilian airports for Dream Chaser started on September 10, 2015, as Dream Chaser-Preferred Landing Site Program. It covers cooperation with authorities and management of Airports around the world for creating appropriate conditions for landing of Dream Chaser after returning from space commercial missions. Receiving certificate from Sierra Nevada Corporation will open door for airport to provide services for Dream Chaser landing and maybe even post flight services. Airports and spaceports in the USA declared readiness for starting process of the certification last year and this number is growing dynamically according to SNC. Sierra Nevada Corporation is also looking for spaceports able to serve as place to launch Dream Chaser. One of considered locations is Texas with Houston Airport System which is at the moment managing three airports.\\n\\nTo airports and spaceports like Houston‚Äôs Ellington Airport or Huntsville International Airport, which are going to open for Dream Chaser in future, joined on November 3 2016, Midland International Air & Space Port. Operated by Midland Development Corporation airport was already earlier certified by FAA as spaceport. Obtaining certificate from SNC means, that Airport has probably first customer utilizing civilian airport during commercial space missions. This fact will result in increasing number of employees and new contracts between Airport and present and future contractors. Certification received by Midland International Air & Space Port is great success for Texas, which is showing how space industry opens locally new business opportunities. In the near future probably next Airport will receive certification. Alabama with Huntsville International Airport are still waiting for FAA certification, which allows officially for landing of space vehicle at airport and will give possibility for receiving SNC certificate.\\n\\nSources:\\n\\nhttp://www.sncorp.com/news-resources/snc-midland-spaceport-11-3-16.html', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://satprnews.com/2020/04/05/long-march-prelaunch-issues-unveiled/', 'published': '2020-04-05T18:10:10', 'title': 'Long March prelaunch issues unveiled ! ‚Äì satPRnews', 'text': 'It is not very common to unveil secrets of Chinese space program by people involved directly with it. Especially when maiden flight of largest rocket ever created by Chinese industry is concerned.\\n\\nFew Chinese specialists present during launch of Long March 5 on November 3, 2016, from Wenchang Satellite Launch Center announced on Chinese social media unknown details about this mission. It seems that Chinese information policy regarding space flights has changed ‚Äì few years ago probably something like that would not be possible. Thanks to this change, we know how dramatic events preceded launch of Long March 5 ‚Äì largest Chinese rocket ever created.\\n\\nFour days before flight appeared first problem. On October 30, 2016 two days after rocket was rolled out from assembling facility to LC-1 launch site it was detected that launch table is misaligned. Launch table is the part which is reflecting whole thrust generated by engines. If it is not installed with specified angle, nozzles of rocket engines will automatically adjusted by rocket‚Äôs onboard thrust control computer even up to maximum values. This can destroy part of the launch tower and even cause disaster of rocket. Of course it is possible to reduce this problem by disassembling boosters and adjusting them in the factory but it means months of delay. CNSA decided to take a risk and luckily, this time nothing wrong happened. But it was not only issue with first flight of Long March 5. Later, as we remember, launch suffered for additional delay and was postponed for over 60 minutes. It was result of additional problems with leaking LOX from two from four boosters supporting Long March 5 during start. It turned out, that there is no leakage and probably failed sensor or data were wrongly interpreted. Next issue appeared at T-90‚Ä≤. Core of the rocket, equipped with two YF-77 engines seemed to have problem with fueling system ‚Äì turbo pumps, which should be chilled with fuel, reported to keep too high temperature. Launch was postponed again for 100 minutes. Specialists decided to input commands manually to valves ‚Äì it helped and about 70 minutes from launch (which took place finally at 12:43 GMT) chilling procedure was resumed. Another issue was recognized after switching rocket to battery power, but it was quickly eliminated by engineers in control center. After launch and smooth flight to orbit, when problems appeared to finish, second stage of the rocket started its propulsion to place Yuanzheng-2 upper stage on GTO orbit. According to some Chinese space forums, propulsion was working not as long as it was planned and was cut off 11 seconds earlier. It was not officially confirmed, but it is worth to remind, that problems with countdown were also not mentioned during live broadcast. Due the shorter time of burn of second stage, Yuanzheng-2 performed prolonged first and second burns to compensate it.', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://satprnews.com/2020/04/05/get-ready-for-expedition-5051/', 'published': '2020-04-05T17:10:12', 'title': 'Get ready for Expedition 50', 'text': 'Preparing for Expedition 50/51 entered into last phase on Earth and on International Space Station.\\n\\nAfter landing of Soyuz MS-01 with Anatoly Ivanishin, Kate Rubins and Takuya Onishi, International Space Station have been occupied only by three crew members: Commander Shane Kimbrough from NASA and Sergey Ryzhikov with Andrei Borisenko, flight engineers from Roscosmos. Expedition 50 with Oleg Novitsky (Roscosmos), Thomas Pesquet (ESA) and Peggy Whitson will reach Station on 19th November 2016, after two days of space journey. It will surely help in increasing productivity of ISS and will help in relieving current crew members, which are responsible not only for scientific experiments, but also for maintenance activities and extracting cargo from Cygnus OA-5 cargo spacecraft.\\n\\nAll three members of Expedition 50/51 arrived to Baikonur from Star City under Moscow, on November 1, 2016, and started their last phase of preparing to flight. They have tried and tested their personal Sokol space suits and begun last training before launch from working inside Soyuz on November 4. In the same time International Space Station was already after preparing for docking of Soyuz MS-03 on 19th November. Day after arrival of Oleg Novitsky, Thomas Pesquet and Peggy Whitson to Baikonur, flight control specialists in Mission Control Center in Korolev under Moscow, prepared Station for rendezvous and docking. They transmitted series of commands to change orbit of ISS orbit using onboard MSK engines on Zvezda module. It was not done as usual, using propulsion of one of docked Progress cargo spacecrafts, but with two main thrusters of Zvezda module. Whole maneuver lasted for 96 seconds and had begun at 03:22 GMT. Two S5.79 engines burning dinitrogen tetroxide and UDMH provided 2.95 kN each and increased speed of ISS for 1.5 m/s.

Ultimate objective for European space program was finally refined: starting independent space access with Ariane 6 in 2020.\\n\\n12 billion Euros by 2020 for Airbus Safrane for supporting mainly Ariane 6 project ‚Äì this is solution for European space program announced on October 24, 2016. European space program after years of public-private partnership programs is still far from space program of Russia, main partner for European space agency ‚Äì ESA. Agency is still relying mostly on Russian launch vehicles and has large number of projects based on Russian technology and experience. It should be considered as sign of common sense that European Commission would like to change this situation. There is no other way for Europe, if EU would like to join leaders like USA, China or Russia. But due the simple reason Ariane 6 seems to be lost chance for bringing European space industry into first league.\\n\\nFirst question should be is it good to invest in Company, which suffers for delays and tried to offer rocket with launch cost beyond level of competitiveness comparing to competition. Well probably not ‚Äì before last official announcements from 2014 and 2015 (concept of Ariane 6 has changed many times) it was rather clear that rocket will not be less expensive than main competitors. But in fact European Commission probably has no other way; last decades resulted in establishing on space market in Europe small number of large Companies like Airbus Safrane. Without any competitors inside EU and achieving something like monopoly, Airbus Safrane with Ariane 6 remains only project European rocket on the market able to deliver large payload. Competition from Russia wins with price, but companies like RKK Energia or TsSKB-Progress are associated in Sate Company Roscosmos; they are interested only in selling launch services with lowest possible price to make creating any launch vehicle in Europe economically unprofitable. European politicians seem to spot this simple fact and would like to spend 12 billion Euros for creating new European rocket. For sure at the moment, when work on Ariane 6 seems to be advanced, it would be hard to find in EU any company with competitive project for less money or even impossible, if we keep in mind 2020 as planned date of the maiden flight of new rocket. Of course, Arianespace and Airbus Safrane still states that new Ariane 6 will be able to deliver up to 10 t to GTO orbit for less than doubled cost of Falcon-9 FT, but not earlier than in 2020. It means, when one of the main competitors for Arianespace, SpaceX will already possess Falcon Heavy (22 t for GTO missions) already for at least two years. Is it possible to reduce launch cost with Ariane 6 under cost of Falcon Heavy with reusable technology? It seems that European Commission strongly believes that it is possible, forgetting about simple fact, that last decade was full of innovations which will not be part of Ariane. In this case money will simply not change anything ‚Äì Ariane 6 will not be next generation launch vehicle but only average construction with more sophisticated competitors.', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://satprnews.com/2020/04/05/muos-5-after-reaching-designated-orbit-entered-yesterday-in-test-phase/', 'published': '2020-04-05T15:10:10', 'title': 'MUOS-5 after reaching designated orbit entered yesterday in test phase ‚Äì satPRnews', 'text': 'U.S. Navy communication satellite MUOS-5 finally reached its designated orbit after prolonged maneuver.\\n\\nExtended time necessary for reaching orbital position was caused by previous problems with main propulsion of MUOS-5. Engineers from Lockheed Martin (main contractor for MUOS-5) and U.S. Navy decided to use instead main IHI BT-4, additional thrusters used for attitude control system. It caused extensive consumption of fuel ‚Äì secondary thrusters were designed to burn only Monomethylhydrazine fuel without Nitrogen Tetroxide oxidizer. During prolonged use they consumed most of fuel providing much less thrust (144 N instead 450 N generated by BT-4). Finally after over three months, MUOS-5 reached specified orbit on October 22. Now it remains on Geostationary Orbit with apogee at 36764 km, perigee at 34810 km and with inclination of 9.6745¬∞ on 105¬∞W slot. Since then, satellite managed to deploy its antennas and performed tests of solar arrays. According to official statement given by U.S. Navy it will start test procedures to confirm, that it is able to operate just as other four MUOS satellites. MUOS-5 will probably enter service in the end of December 2016 or in the early 2017.\\n\\nProblems with MUOS-5 started on early July, when satellite failed to finish second part of orbit raise maneuver. After performing series of self-tests and taking pictures of exterior of MUOS by one of Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program satellites, it was decided to use onboard attitude control system thrusters to raise the orbit. These thrusters, made by Aerojet Rocketdyne, were designed to be used for course correction and performing precision maneuvers. Twelve MR-103G are generating 1N of thrust along with six stronger MR-106L 22 N thrusters are fueled with Monomethylhydrazine without additional oxidizer. These thrusters are fueled only with single component propellant and used in ACS due their small dimensions and simplified construction comparing two bi-fuel thrusters; as they are used for short burns their fuel consumption level is less important factor, just as their relatively low thrust. IHI BT-4 was design to provide 450 N of thrust and consume much more oxidizer then fuel, in case of using attitude control thrusters we have reversed situation. During prolonged burn, ACS thrusters used most of fuel from tanks. Now MUOS-5, which was launched as backup satellite for operating over Indian Ocean MUOS-4, probably is not meeting basic demands of its missions. Even if there is any amount of fuel in tanks, probably it will not be enough to perform any orbital maneuver, not to mention about operating for planned 15 years. Most possible solution in this situation is swapping MUOS-5 with MUOS-2 remaining on 100¬∞ W slot. It could serve as backup without interrupting whole constellation, while MUOS-5 would operate as regular MUOS satellite. Probably U.S. Navy will not have any other option and will be forced to use older MUOS-2 launched in 2013 (which still for sure has more fuel than MUOS-5). Leaving MUOS-5 close to libration point will help in reducing number of burns necessary to keep correct course, but still predicted operational life of it is reduced comparing to original plan. Most possible is keeping satellites in described configuration and sending refueling satellite to MUOS-5 as soon as possible.', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://satprnews.com/2020/04/05/long-march-5-debut-delayed-but-successful/', 'published': '2020-04-05T14:10:10', 'title': 'Long March 5 debut delayed but successful ! ‚Äì satPRnews', 'text': 'Maiden flight of Long March 5 heavy rocket started with 100 minutes of delay but finished with full success. It is already second maiden flight of Chinese rocket in 2016 performed from Wenchang Satellite Launch Center in Hainan Province and one from multiple successes of CNSA in present year.\\n\\nLong March 5 is for sure important point of creating fleet of new rockets for CNSA; Long March 7 launched on June 25 was designed as medium rocket; it should be considered as launch vehicle for future Chinese spacecraft and replacement of Long March 2F (which remains in service since 1999). Also because of its modular construction it will cover most of launches conducted in China in following years. Long March 5 is heavy rocket comparable to Falcon-9 FT, Ariane 5 or Delta IV Heavy. Its usage is limited mainly for delivering heavy satellites and parts of the future modular space station planned by CNSA for 2020s. But in spite of number of differences, Long March 5 and Long March 7 are quite similar: they are using same engines and propellant and are sharing place of launch: Wenchang Satellite Launch Center (Launch Complex 101 is designated only for Long March 5, Launch Complex 201 is reserved for Long March 7).\\n\\nLong March 5 have been waiting for launch since Friday October 28, when it was rolled out from assembling facility building. Today, launch was postponed for 100 minutes from 11:00 GMT to 12:40 GMT due the poor weather conditions over Wenchang Satellite Launch Center. Actually sky was covered with clouds and whole Launch Complex 101 was covered with fog. At 12:04 pressurizing of the fuel tanks started, but unfortunately live broadcast was terminated. Transmission was resumed shortly before start. Engines were ignited at 12:43 GMT and rocket finally started its maiden flight. Just after reaching safe distance from Launch Pad rocket started to fly towards East. At T+3‚Ä≤ boosters were jettisoned and two minutes later payload fairing was released. At T+9‚Ä≤ first stage was cut off and separated when rocket was flying on 127¬∞ East course on altitude of 196 km. At T+16‚Ä≤ second stage was cut off and it continued ballistic flight with exposed YZ-2 upper stage. After ten minutes engine started again for six minutes and was cut off just before separation with YZ-2 at 13:14 GMT, just before separation of YZ-2 on altitude of 350 km. Upper stage started propulsion one minute later and was cut off seven minutes later. Second and last burn will be performed at T+5h53‚Äô40‚Äù and will last for 20 minutes.\\n\\nLong March 5 is liquid fueled rocket designed by China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT). Depending on configuration it can use 0, 2 or 4 boosters combined with core based on 2 or 3 stages. Rocket was designed as more environment friendly, what is present trend in designing Chinese rockets. Boosters are fueled with RP-1/LOX; first and second stages of the core of the rocket are fueled with LH/LOX. Rocket length is planned for 62 m with diameter at 5 m and total mass at 867 t. Rocket will be able to deliver 25 t of payload to LEO orbit with altitude of 200 km and 14 t to GTO. CALT also designed restartable upper stage Yuanzheng-2 (YZ-2), which can be used for Long March 5. It is long for with diameter of 5.2 m and mass of 1800 kg. Payload fairing for Long March 5 has maximal dimensions of 12.5 m (length) x 5.2 m (diameter).\\n\\nVersion used for maiden flight was shorter, with length of 56 m and was equipped with four strap on boosters. It weighed 869 t with boosters, two stages and YZ-2 upper stage. Each booster was long for 26.28 m with 3.25 m of diameter. Propulsion of the each booster is based on two YF-100 engines (designed by Xi‚Äôan Aerospace Propulsion Institute and utilized also by Long March 5) burning 135 t of propellant and providing thrust of 1200 kN. First stage is long for 31.02 m and is powered with two YF-77 engines (designed by Academy of Aerospace Liquid Propulsion Technology) burning 158 t of propellant. They are generating thrust of 510 kN each. Second stage is significantly shorter ‚Äì it is long for 12 m with identical diameter at 5 m. It stores 22.9 t of propellant and is powered by two YF-75D engines providing thrust at 88.26 kN.\\n\\nUPDATE 11/11/2016: YZ-2 upper stage delivered directly to GEO orbit Shijian-17 research satellite.', 'author': []}, {'link': 'https://satprnews.com/2020/04/05/himawari-9-launched-on-atop-of-h-iia-f31/', 'published': '2020-04-05T13:10:17', 'title': 'Himawari-9 launched on atop of H-IIA F31! ‚Äì satPRnews', 'text': 'Japanese weather satellite Himawari-9 was launched today at 07:21 GMT from Tanegashima Space Center.

Himawari-9 mission was preceded by mission of Himawari-8, which started on October 7, 2014. Both satellites were ordered by Japanese government at Mitsubishi Electric. Mitsubishi, which is also manufacturer of H-II launch vehicle, decided to choose Boing as subcontractor for developing payload for Himawari satellites.\\n\\nLaunch of the H-IIA (202) F31 was planned for 15:20 JST (06:20 GMT). Since early morning hours weather at Tanegashima Island was favorable; engineers finished uploading wind data for H-IIA onboard computers around 06:00 GMT; rocket was standing at Launch Pad 1 at Yoshinobu Space Complex since yesterday, when it was rolled out from assembling facility. Now, twenty minutes before T=0, rocket was almost ready for starting automated countdown procedure planned to begin at T-4‚Äô30. Payload was reported as ready for the mission at 06:15 GMT and one minute later, rocket was already using own power system an fuel tanks started to be pressurized. One minute before planned T=0 (06:19 GMT) special water curtain system was turned on to prevent extended noise generated by rocket. At 06:20 GMT rocket ignited first stage and two boosters and started to rise over Launch Pad 1.

It was used in 202 configuration; rocket in this version weighs 285 t with total length of 53 m and diameter at 4 m. During start it is supported with two SRB-A solid fueled rocket boosters. Each SRB booster, fueled with HTPB, is generating thrust at 4520 kN. Rocket is capable to deliver 4100 kg to Geostationary Transfer Orbit. First stage is powered with LE-7A engine fueled with LOX/LH2 and generating thrust at 1098 kN. Second stage is equipped with LE-5B engine, which is also fueled with LOX/LH2 and is generating thrust at 137 kN.\\n\\nTwo Himawari satellites delivered by Melco are replacements for Himawari-6 and Himawari-7 satellites, which finished their service life planned for 15 years. Designed with utilization of DS-2000 bus, Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 are also designed to serve without minor problems 15 years on GEO orbit. Himawari-9 launched today will stay at GEO 140¬∞ East orbital slot. It will reach GEO starting its travel from GTO orbit of 250 km x 35976 km (with inclination of 22.4¬∞). Himawari-9 weighs 3500 kg (1300 kg dry mass) and is powered by single gallium-arsenide solar array providing 2.6 kW for onboard systems and scientific instruments and for charging onboard battery. It will use its 16 channel multispectral imager over Asian-Pacific and provide detailed images (with resolution of 0.5 km ‚Äì 2 km) in visible light and infrared.

people symptoms similar covid  dont actually coronavirus havent seen much research question thermometer data seems find around percent us population typically feels sick point year scenarios assume given time percent population symptoms resemble severe covid  symptoms reasons coronavirus say bad flu bronchitis pneumonia percent symptoms resemble mild covid  symptoms reasons coronavirus say mild flu bad cold furthermore assume people severe symptoms seek testing that is would get tested could half people mild symptoms percent asymptomatic people do assumptions also changed spreadsheet wait theres more dont really consider scenarios \"model\" way fivethirtyeight usually uses term were trying predict anything were trying show different testing strategies impact number reported cases but case real coronavirus models awful lot messy real world problems need consider too one theres long lag someone infected develop symptoms get tested test resus reported wuhan china lag development symptoms test resus reported around days considering usually takes least days symptoms develop lag infection case showing test statistics going longer still scenarios therefore assume theres delay days or three generations infection test resus showing data though anything suspect generous given huge testing bottlenecks places california another real world problem tests arent perfect fact according reporting wall street journal thursday around percent people actually covid  test negative wed call false negative estimates false negatives arent quite high assume percent false negative rate scenarios then course theres also question false positives ie test reports someone covid  actually dont number harder pin down infer tests rarely produce false positives why? iceland large numbers asymptomatic people tested overall rate positive tests among group slightly percent given includes people probably coronavirus since asymptomatic cases fairly common assume rate false positives even lower purpose scenarios well guess its percent however theres bit mathematical twist calculating false positives even false positives rare false positives may swand true positives underlying incidence disease low say instance early stages outbreak town  people people percent population actually disease everyone gets tested roughly false positives  percent population larger number people actually sick discourse around false positive tests confusing true rate false positives fairly low high share positive tests false better worse becomes less issue new infections muiply lots real positives longer drown false positives finally set assumptions make many tests conducted gets tested vary scenario scenario lets work scenarios now scenario robust growth testing emphasize

detected later first scenario covidia like real world countries little slow undertake social distancing measures take intermediate steps march  time  people already infected though far fewer positive tests just  reported march  number cases still rapidly increasing covidia implements full stay at home order what im informally calling \"lockdown\" reduces less one better news testing situation

tested tests percent accurate   day delay would resu times newly infected people population number newly reported positive tests given time delay matters less declines disease isnt growing fast arent many new people get infected  day period infection test resus still means were always looking two weeks past whenever \"new\" data reported remember social distancing measures effective flattening curve may take two three weeks show data especially demand testing near peak likely longer lags processing test resus next even relatively good testing youre still likely miss many cases end scenario june  million people infected point covidia  detected cases detection rate percent and false positives actual situation bit worse that accounts missing cases? first assume many people mild symptoms symptoms want get tested and nobody forces get tested get infected point without ever realizing it next percent false negative rate means cases missed finally even testing rands quickly may rand quite fast disease itself actual peak new infections scenario comes march point testing fully scaled lot people would like test still cannot get one theres also third issue testing increasing rate growth disease overestimated aernatively testing stagnant decreasing rate growth underestimated note scenario  youd infer number reported cases peaks  actual based infections quite high  covidia began implementing social distancing measures words rapid rates growth new cases see country say germany first gets serious testing function number tests increasing number infections increasing its hard tell whats what also problems theres sudden one off increase tests well see next scenario final issue im going boldface its less important others late stages scenario little disease transmission

subjective choices documented transparently detail even begin consider treating output fact data gathered whether gathered way time matters theres also issue uncollected inaccurate data determine fatality rate divide number people died disease number people infected disease case dont really reliable count number people infected so put mathematically dont know denominator if were honest

diamond princess became living laboratory kind data documentation conditions dont usually get real world researchers able capture many people disease also many completely asymptomatic thus would likely gone untested undiagnosed uncounted land resus unusual setup suggest lot people walking around covid  dont know and consequently death rates lower data suggested diamond princess population fatality rate people diagnosis symptoms percent fatality rate diagnosed cases including asymptomatic percent iceland company called decode genetics started offering free screenings general asymptomatic population march march  decode identified infected people sandle  tests including asymptomatic infections meanwhile symptomaticity ratio‚Äî many people symptomatic versus asymptomatic‚Äî

widespread testing beginning really matters primarily test sick people states doing fatality rate isnt going reflect anything like actual fatality rate virus the denominator problem rears head again testing us handered additional issues overall lack available tests fact private labs dont provide number tests came negative true fatality rate disease also influenced ability prevent death someone grievously ill depends hospital capacity given unlimited access intensive care unit beds ventilators many people even severe symptoms could survive infection resources relatively scarce demand exceeds supply already parts country people would survived ventilator likely die knock on effects people seeking treat the momentent unrelated accidents emergencies could also suffer lack hospital resources
